Remote control method of electronic equipment and electronic equipment
[0001]
Technical Field
[0002]
The present invention relates to the field of electronic technology, and in particular to a
remote control method of an electronic device and the electronic device.
[0003]
Background Art
[0004]
Currently, the main control input methods for human-computer desktop interaction include
mouse, keyboard, touch screen, gesture recognition device, etc.
These control methods all require additional, specialized command input devices, resulting
in a large amount of redundancy in computer input devices.
Moreover, the input device is tightly coupled to the computer, and one input device usually
corresponds to only one computer. Therefore, it is difficult to flexibly control multiple
computers using one input device, and it is also difficult for multiple people to control one
computer using multiple input devices.
[0005]
16-07-2025 - Page 2
At the same time, in many cases, users hope to use computers conveniently and quickly, and
the most effective way is to use the electronic devices that users carry with them as input
devices.
For example, a user uses a mobile phone to control a computer at a certain distance.
[0006]
The solution proposed in the prior art is to use a mobile phone as a remote control to control
a PC, a TV or other computer equipment. The disadvantages of this solution are:
[0007]
1) The remote control method is monotonous, usually only including channel selection and
basic settings; 2) The interoperability is poor, and the smart TV desktop cannot be
interactively operated; 3) The flexibility is low, the mobile phone and TV are highly coupled,
and users cannot quickly switch between multiple TVs; 4) It is impossible to achieve visible
and controllable.
[0008]

DETAILED DESCRIPTION
[0053]
An embodiment of the present invention provides a remote control method for an electronic
device, the method being applied between a first electronic device and a second electronic
device, wherein the first electronic device and the second electronic device are connected
wirelessly, the first electronic device comprises an image acquisition device and a touch
display unit, and the second electronic device comprises a display unit, the method
comprising: the first electronic device acquires a real-time image including a first display
content displayed by the display unit through the image acquisition device, and displays the
real-time image in the touch display unit; establishes a first display coordinate conversion
relationship between display coordinates corresponding to the real-time image and display
coordinates corresponding to the first display content; detects touch operation information
received by the touch display unit, determines whether the touch point coordinates of the
touch operation correspond to the first display content included in the real-time image
according to the touch operation information, and if so, converts the touch point coordinates
corresponding to the touch operation into second coordinates in the display unit according
to the first display coordinate conversion relationship, and sends a touch command in the
touch operation information to the second electronic device, so that the second electronic
device implements an operation on the second coordinate position through the touch
command.
[0054]
The method provided in the embodiment of the present invention is applied in a first
electronic device and a second electronic device, wherein the first electronic device is
connected to the second electronic device in a wireless manner, the first electronic device
includes an image acquisition device and a touch display unit, and the second electronic
device includes a display unit.
The image acquisition device of the first electronic device may be a camera, and the camera
captures all contents displayed on the display unit of the second electronic device, and
displays the captured image contents in real time on the touch display unit.
16-07-2025 - Page 10
A coordinate correspondence between the image content and the display content of the
display unit is established, so that the user can observe the desktop of the display unit on the
touch display unit, and can also operate and control the second electronic device by
operating the touch display unit.
The operation control includes all mouse type control commands and some advanced
commands, such as forward, backward, zoom, return, shutdown, copy and paste, etc.
[0055]
Furthermore, the distance between the first electronic device and the second electronic

function between the touch display unit coordinates and the display unit desktop
coordinates.
In addition, two cameras are provided to realize digital zooming of the captured images
through the zoom camera, presenting the details of the controlled desktop to the user for
easy user control.
[0056]
Embodiment 1, as shown in FIG1 , an embodiment of the present invention provides a
remote control method for an electronic device, the method being applied between a first
electronic device and a second electronic device, wherein the first electronic device and the
second electronic device are connected wirelessly, the first electronic device comprises an
image acquisition device and a touch display unit, the second electronic device comprises a
display unit, and in this embodiment, the image acquisition device comprises a camera.
The specific implementation of the present invention is described in detail below with
reference to the accompanying drawings:
[0057]
In the embodiment of the present invention, the display unit of the controlled electronic
device (the second electronic device according to the above conditions) is within the
scanning range of the image acquisition device.
[0058]
In this implementation, if the device camera or the display unit included in the second
electronic device is also a touch display unit, reverse control of the first electronic device can
also be achieved at the same time.
16-07-2025 - Page 11
[0059]
Step 101: The first electronic device obtains a real-time image including the first display
content displayed by the display unit through the image acquisition device, and displays the
real-time image on the touch display unit;
[0060]
In an embodiment of the present invention, the first display content can be all the contents
of the current desktop of the display unit (as shown in Figure 2, where the diameter of the
scanned area of the image acquisition device of the first electronic device is a-b), or it can be
a part of the contents of the current desktop of the display unit (as shown in Figure 3).
In order to expand the scope of application of the method provided by the embodiment of
the present invention, the first electronic device may be inclined at a certain angle to the
horizontal plane (as shown in FIG. 4 , and a simplified diagram is shown in FIG. 5 , where the
diameter of the scanned area of the image acquisition device of the first electronic device is
a-b), with the lower left corner of the display unit of the second electronic device as the
origin of the reference coordinate system, and the bottom edge as the reference line.
The tilt angle is determined by the reference line.
[0061]
In the embodiment of the present invention, the image acquisition device acquires the
image in real time and needs to perform an update operation on the real-time image once
the display content of the display unit changes.
[0062]
In this implementation, the method for achieving real-time control of the display unit
desktop content may be: periodically obtaining the content displayed on the display unit
desktop.
The display content currently acquired is compared with the display content previously
acquired. If the different pixel values are greater than a preset value, it is determined that
the desktop content of the display unit has changed, and the real-time image is updated.
[0063]
Step 102, establishing a first display coordinate conversion relationship between the display
coordinates corresponding to the real-time image and the display coordinates
corresponding to the first display content;
16-07-2025 - Page 12
[0064]
This step also includes performing an image recognition operation on the real-time image or
determining the first display content in the real-time image through selection information
input by a user.
[0065]
The method provided in the present invention can be implemented in a variety of ways to
determine the first content in the real-time image. The following is a further description of
determining the first display content in the real-time image in two ways: image recognition
and user selection, which specifically include:
[0066]
(1) performing an image recognition operation on the real-time image to determine
boundary information of a first display content in the real-time image, and obtaining a first
display coordinate set included in an area determined by the boundary information;
[0067]
Determining a second display coordinate set corresponding to the first display content in the
display unit;
[0068]
A display coordinate conversion relationship between the first display coordinate set and the
second display coordinate set is established.
[0069]
(2) accepting image selection information input by a user, and determining boundary
information of a first display content from the real-time image according to the selection
information, and acquiring a first display coordinate set included in the area determined by
the boundary information;
[0070]
In this embodiment, when image recognition is performed, a selection box is displayed on
the touch display unit (as shown in FIG. 6 ).
16-07-2025 - Page 13
By receiving the control information input by the user, the selection box is moved and
scaled, so that the boundary of the first display content is overlapped with the boundary of
the selection box, or the part of the first display content that needs corresponding operation
control is selected in the selection box.
[0071]
Determining a second display coordinate set corresponding to the first display content in the
display unit;
[0072]
A display coordinate conversion relationship between the first display coordinate set and the
second display coordinate set is established.
[0073]
Step 103: Detect the touch operation information received by the touch display unit, and
determine whether the touch point coordinates of the touch operation correspond to the
first display content included in the real-time image according to the touch operation
information; if so, convert the touch point coordinates corresponding to the touch operation
into second coordinates in the display unit according to the first display coordinate
conversion relationship, and send the touch command in the touch operation information to
the second electronic device, so that the second electronic device can implement the
operation on the second coordinate position through the touch command.
[0074]
In the implementation of the present invention, because the first electronic device can obtain
a part of the desktop display content of the display unit, it is necessary to determine whether
the coordinates of the touch point when the user performs a touch operation correspond to
the first display image included in the real-time image. If so, it is determined that the touch
operation is a touch operation performed on the display unit.
[0075]
The touch operation information includes touch point coordinates and touch operation
instructions.
[0076]
16-07-2025 - Page 14
In the embodiment of the present invention, the first electronic device is generally a
handheld device with a touch display unit, so in a specific application, there may be a change
in the relative displacement between the first electronic device and the second electronic
device. Therefore, after the relative displacement changes, it is necessary to update the
display coordinate conversion relationship in real time. The specific implementation method
includes:
[0077]
Detecting the distance between the first electronic device and the second electronic device, if
the first distance currently detected is different from the second distance previously
detected, acquiring a second real-time image currently displayed in the touch display unit,
and determining that the second real-time image includes the second display content
displayed by the display unit;
[0078]
A second display coordinate conversion relationship between the display coordinates
corresponding to the second real-time image and the display coordinates corresponding to
the second display content is established, and the first display coordinate conversion
relationship is updated with the second display coordinate conversion relationship.
[0079]
In step 102, the process of establishing a first display coordinate conversion relationship
between the display coordinates corresponding to the real-time image and the display
coordinates corresponding to the first display content may be implemented as follows:
[0080]
The first electronic device records the ratio of the horizontal and vertical coordinates of the
user's touch point to the border of the display unit in the real-time image.
That is, the ratio of the horizontal coordinate of the user's touch point to the horizontal
border is XR, and the ratio of the vertical coordinate to the vertical border is YR.
After obtaining these two values, they are transmitted to the second electronic device, and
the second electronic device then knows the position of the user's touch point.
Therefore, in this implementation, the second electronic device only needs to determine the
horizontal inclination angle of the local device, the length of the controlled computer frame
16-07-2025 - Page 15
(calculated in pixels), and the coordinates of the user's touch point on the local device to
determine the correspondence between the touch operation coordinates in the touch
display unit and the coordinates in the display unit.
The determination method in specific applications is:
[0081]
As shown in FIG5 , the correspondence between the desktop of the display unit 502 and the
real-time image displayed by the touch display unit L, this method needs to convert the
touch coordinates of the user on the touch screen into coordinates based on the display unit,
and the conversion formula can be implemented by the following steps:
[0082]
In order to avoid loss of generality, it is necessary to record the tilt angle of the second
electronic device, take the lower left corner of L as the origin of the reference coordinate
system, record the origin coordinates of RL as (x0, y0), and the coordinates of the user touch
point U as (xL, yL). Thus, the corresponding straight line function of the four sides of RL can
be established, where the lengths of sides a and b can be recorded as la and lb (the pixels of
L can be used as the unit):
[0083]
Let the straight line functions of sides a and b be: fa(x), fb(x);
[0084]
The distances from point U to edges a and b can be obtained, namely da and db,
respectively. From this, the relative coordinates of point U in RL can be obtained, XR=db/lb
and YR=da/la.
[0085]
Further, in order to facilitate the operation of the user, the image acquisition device of the
first electronic device in the embodiment of the present invention may include two cameras,
the two cameras are a panoramic camera and a zoom camera respectively, when the user
performs a touch operation on the real-time image in the touch display unit, the first
electronic device acquires the real-time image including the first display content displayed by
the display unit through the image acquisition device, including:
[0086]
16-07-2025 - Page 16
Acquire all display contents currently displayed by the display unit through the panoramic
camera;
[0087]
The received image zoom instruction controls the adjustment zoom camera to obtain a
zoomed image of any area in the display unit (the enlarged real-time image is shown in
Figure 7).
[0088]
In this embodiment, in case of the panoramic camera dual camera, the two cameras are G-
camera and Z-camera.
Among them, G-camera is a fixed-focus camera (i.e. panoramic camera) that can capture the
entire screen of the controlled computer.
Z-camera is a zoom camera (i.e. a zoom camera), and users can change the Z-camera to
perform zoom shooting.
[0089]
In the embodiment of the present invention, coordinate conversion refers to converting the
coordinates of a click on the first electronic device into the corresponding coordinates on the
desktop of the second electronic device (controlled device).
The conversion formula is related to the distance between the first electronic device and the
desktop of the second electronic device, the G-Camera angle, and the zoom multiple. The
conversion formula can be implemented by the following steps:
[0090]
As shown in FIG8 , if the plane of the second electronic device is R1-R4, the user's G-Camera
can take a panoramic photo of the desktop of the second electronic device and project it on
G1-G2.
When the user uses the Z-Camera to browse, the user moves forward and backward with the
straight line x as the axis. It is assumed that the wide angle of the lens remains unchanged
during the movement.
[0091]
When the Z-Camera moves to the position shown in the figure, the range displayed on the
touch screen is the R2-R3 segment.
16-07-2025 - Page 17
The meanings of the symbols in Figure XX are shown in Table 1.
[0092]
<img file="BDA0000147098690000111.TIF" he="529" img-content="drawing" img-format="
tif" inline="no" orientation="portrait" wi="700"/>
[0093]
Table 1
[0094]
Take the horizontal axis as an example to derive the conversion formula:
[0095]
The goal of coordinate conversion is to convert the coordinates of the user's operating point
P on the Z-Camera to the corresponding point Q on the plane of the second electronic
device.
[0096]
The relative position of the user touch point P satisfies
[0098]
Among them, R <sub> 2 </sub> R <sub> 3 </sub> is determined by the user adjusting the
camera magnification, so R <sub> 2 </sub> R <sub> 3 </sub> is the product of the zoom ratio
and the panoramic range OR <sub> 5 </sub>, so:
[0099]
R <sub> 2 </sub> R <sub> 3 </sub> =β*OR <sub> 5 </sub> ,
[0100]
so
[0101]
According to the above figure, we can also infer
16-07-2025 - Page 18
[0103]
OR <sub> 2 </sub> =tanθ(x <sub> 0 </sub> x <sub> 2 </sub> -x <sub> 0 </sub> x <sub> 1 <
/sub> )
[0104]
OR <sub> 5 </sub> =2tanθ*x <sub> 0 </sub> x <sub> 2 </sub> +G <sub> 0 </sub> G <sub> 2 <
/sub>
[0105]
Since R <sub> 1 </sub> Q(R <sub> 2 </sub> O-R <sub> 1 </sub> O)+R <sub> 2 </sub> Q, after
comprehensive arrangement, the horizontal coordinate R <sub> 1 </sub> Q of point Q is
obtained as follows:
[0107]
As shown in FIG9 , according to the above method, the present invention further provides an
electronic device, which is connected to a second electronic device by wireless means, and
the electronic device includes an image acquisition unit 901 and a touch display unit 902,
including:
[0108]

The control unit 904 is used to detect the touch operation information received by the touch

correspond to the first display content contained in the real-time image according to the
touch operation information; if so, convert the touch point coordinates corresponding to the
16-07-2025 - Page 19
touch operation into second coordinates in the display unit according to the first display
coordinate conversion relationship, and send the touch command in the touch operation
information to the second electronic device, so that the second electronic device can
implement the operation on the second coordinate position through the touch command.
[0111]
The correspondence establishing unit 903 is further configured to perform an image
recognition operation on the real-time image or determine the first display content in the
real-time image through selection information input by a user.
[0112]
The electronic device provided by the embodiment of the present invention can determine
the first content in the real-time image in a variety of ways. The following further describes
the determination of the first display content in the real-time image in two ways: image

determined by the boundary information; determine a second display coordinate set
corresponding to the first display content in the display unit; and establish a display
coordinate conversion relationship between the first display coordinate set and the second
display coordinate set.
[0114]

input by a user, and determine boundary information of the first display content from the
real-time image according to the selection information, and obtain a first display coordinate
set included in the area determined by the boundary information; determine a second

establish a display coordinate conversion relationship between the first display coordinate
set and the second display coordinate set.
[0115]
16-07-2025 - Page 20

of the first electronic device in the embodiment of the present invention may include two
cameras, which are a panoramic camera 1001 and a zoom camera 1002:
[0116]

display unit;
[0117]
The zoom camera 1002 is used to obtain a zoomed image of any area in the display content
of the display unit through the received image zoom instruction.
[0118]
In the embodiment of the present invention, the first electronic device is generally a
handheld device with a touch display unit, so in a specific application, there may be a change
