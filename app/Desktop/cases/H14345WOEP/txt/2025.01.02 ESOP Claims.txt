    that is located in a same network as the first device, and/or a device that logs in to a same user

    account as the first device;

           displaying, by the first device, identifiers of N second devices in response to an operation

    performed on one of the at least one control, wherein the N second devices comprise a second

    device in the M second devices on which a second application is installed-iewtheMseeendedevieee,

10 and the second application and the first application provide a same resource;,wherein

                         the N second devices snecificaii comprise a Second device on which a second application

           of meset version is installed in the M second devices or

                         the N second devices specifically comprise a second device on Which the second

           abniication and an operatimI system of Dreset version are installed in the M second devices

15         and

           detecting, by the first device, a first operation performed on one of the identifiers of the N

    second devices, and invoking a resource of a second device corresponding to the identifier on
