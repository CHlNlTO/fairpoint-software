1        Clarity and Conciseness (Art. 84 EPC)

1.1      Claim 1 reads: " wherein the N second devices comprise a second device on

         which a second application is installed in the M second devices". This is not

         understood, rephrasing is required. From what it guessed that this sentence

         means, a possible rephrasing would be: "wherein the N second devices

         comprise a second device, in the M second devices, on which a second

         application is installed".

2        Novelty and Inventive Step (Art. 52(1), 54 and 56 EPC)

2.1 The present application does not meet the requirements of Article 52(1) EPC
          because the subject-matter of claim 1 is not new within the meaning of Article
          54(1) and (2) EPC.

          although this is just an example, and there may be more than one source device
          and/or more than one target device.)

          displaying, by a first device, a first interface provided by a first
           application, wherein at least one control is displayed in the first interface;

           detecting, by the first device, M second devices, wherein the second
           device comprises a device that is located in a same network as the first
           device, and/or a device that logs in to a same user account as the first
           device;

          discovery module on a source device, such as device 102, 200, and/or 302
           identifies remote devices via a network connection. Responsive to discovering
           remote devices, the remote device discovery module can request and receive
           remote device trust information, including a user profile, a group user profile, a
          user preference setting, or any other way to determine the trust of the remote
           device.
           At block 604, the model remote control module on the source device, such as
           model remote control module 400 processes the remote device trust
           information, and determines if the remote device can be trusted. In some
           examples, a remote device sharing a user profile with the source device can be
          trusted.)

          displaying, by the first device, identifiers of N second devices in response
           to an operation performed on one of the at least one control, wherein the
           N second devices comprise a second device on which a second
           application is installed in the M second devices, and the second
           application and the first application provide a same resource; and

           (paragraph [00108] - paragraph[00117]: At block 606 the model remote control
           module on the source device can send an application discovery query message
           to one or more trusted remote devices. The application discovery query can
           include a request for application capability data on the one or more trusted
           devices, including the ability of an application to perform a particular task, the

           data, such as device memory, speed, and/or display capability, for the one or
           more trusted devices.)

           (paragraph [00108] - paragraph[00117]: At block 608, responsive to the
           application discovery query, the model remote control module on the source
           device receives a discovery response message. The discovery response
           message can include an indication of at least one application capable of
          performing the task on the one or more trusted remote devices, application
           capabilities for the at least one application, and/or device capabilities for the one
          or more trusted remote devices. In some examples, the one or more discovery
           response messages can include a notification that a remote device and/or
           application on a remote device is not capable of executing the task.
           At block 610, the model remote control module on the source device can
           receive a plurality of discovery response messages. A remote application
           discovery client can process the plurality of discovery response messages, and
           send remote application files to a remote application file limiter, such as remote
           application file limiter 408.)

           detecting, by the first device, a first operation performed on one of the
           identifiers of the N second devices, and invoking a resource of a second
           device corresponding to the identifier on which the first operation is
           performed.

           (paragraph [00108] - paragraph [001 17]: At block 612, an application on the
           source device, via the remote application file limiter, can select a remote
           application file for activation and/or control. In various examples, a user, via
           input on a user interface can select the remote application file for activation and/
           or control)

           (paragraph [00108] - paragraph[00117]: At block 614, responsive to the
          selection of the remote application file associated with an application, the model
          remote control module on the source device sends an application activation
           message to the remote device containing the application. In some examples the
           application activation message can be sent to one or more remote devices
          containing the application. The application activation message can include a
          direction for the particular remote device to activate the application and run the
           requested task from the application discovery query. In some examples, the
           model remote control module on the source device can send a background task
          activation message to the one or more remote devices.)

2.2 The subject-matter of independent claims 9, 10 and 11 corresponds in terms of,
           respectively, "device , computer program" and "computer-readable storage
           with instructions" to that of claim 1. The objections raised in respect of this latter
           claim, therefore, also apply, mutatis mutandis, to independent claims 9, 10 and
          11.

3      Novelty and Inventive Step of the dependent claims

3.1    Dependent claims 2-8 do not appear to contain any additional features which, in

       combination with the features of any claim to which it refers, meet the

       requirements of the EPC with respect to novelty / Inventive Step.

3.2 The extra features of claim 2 are obvious from D1, (D1 paragraph 112)

3.3 The extra features of claim 3 are disclosed in D1, (D1 paragraph 50)

3.4 The extra features of claim 4 are obvious from D1, (D1 paragraph 115)

3.5 The extra features of claim 5 are disclosed in D1, (D1 paragraph 116-117)

3.6 The extra features of claim 6 are obvious from D1, (D1 paragraph 115, 116-117)

3.7 The extra features of claim 7 are obvious from D1, (D1 paragraph 115, 116-117)

3.8 The extra features of claim 8 are disclosed in D1, (D1 figure 6, "610 NO")

4      Further Objections

4.1    Independent claim 1 is not in the two-part form in accordance with Rule 43(1)

       EPC. If, however, the applicant is of the opinion that the two-part form would be

       inappropriate, reasons therefor should be provided.

4.2 The features of the claims should be provided with reference signs placed in
          parentheses to increase the intelligibility of the claims (Rule 43(7) EPC). This
           applies to both the preamble and characterising portion (see EPC Guidelines F-
           IV, 4.18).

4.3 To meet the requirements of Rule 42(1)(b) EPC, D1 should be identified in the
           description and the relevant background art disclosed therein should be briefly
           discussed.

4.4 The statement in the description, page 1, 1st paragraph, concerning the
          incorporation of cited document by reference should be removed (GL. Part F,
          Chapter |||-8).

5.1 It is not at present apparent which part of the application could serve as a basis
           for a new, allowable claim. Should the applicant nevertheless regard some
           particular matter as patentable, an independent claim should be filed taking
          account of Rule 43(1) EPC.
           The applicant should convincingly argue novelty and inventive step of the newly
           filed independent claims. A convincing argument should indicate the features of
          the newly filed independent claims that cannot be found in D1. In addition, the
           inventive concept underlying these distinctive features should be explained by
           using the problem-solution approach. Merely stating that the prior art documents
          disclose different features, solve another problem or belong to a different field
          will fail to prove novelty and inventive step.

5.2 In order to comply with the requirements of Rule 137(4) EPC, the applicant
          should clearly identify the amendments made, irrespective of whether they
          concern amendments by addition, replacement or deletion, and indicate the
           passages of the application as filed on which these amendments are based
          (see Guidelines H III, 2.1).

5.3 Amendments should be made by filing replacement pages. Unnecessary
          recasting of the description should be avoided. An amended abstract is not
          required. The applicant should also take account of the requirements of Rule
           50(1) EPC. According to Rule 50(1) in conjunction with Rule 49(8) EPC,
           amendments shall be typed or printed.

5.4 When filing amended claims the applicant should at the same time bring the
          description into conformity with the amended claims. Care should be taken
          during revision, especially of the introductory portion and of any statements of
           problem or advantage, not to add subject-matter which extends beyond the
          content of the application as originally filed (Article 123(2) EPC).

5.4.1 The description should be amended where appropriate to fulfil the following
           requirements:

    -- The technical field of the invention (Rule 42(1)(a) EPC; Guidelines F-||.4.2) must
        correspond to the amended set of claims.

    -- The summary of the invention (Rule 42(1)(c) EPC; Guidelines F-||.4.5) must
        correspond to the amended set of claims. Where appropriate, statements such as
        "The invention is set out in the appended set of claims" or "The invention is as
       defined in claim X" may be used instead of repeating the claims verbatim.

        Embodiments which are no longer covered by the claims must be deleted, unless
        they can reasonably be considered to be useful for highlighting specific aspects of
        the amended subject-matter. If this is the case, they must be clearly marked as not
        being part of the present invention (T 1808/06 and Guidelines F-IV, 4.3)

             - For example, independent claim X has been amended by limiting it to
                Feature A. Ways of carrying out the invention using features presented as
                alternatives to this feature must either be deleted or the fact that they are not
                encompassed by the claims must be clearly stated.

            - Any combinations of features which do not fall under the scope of the
               amended independent claims must be clearly marked as not being part of
                the present invention.

             - Statements such as "The following examples/aspects/embodiments X, Y, Z
               are not according to the invention and are present for illustration purposes
                only" may be used at the start of the description or in the list of figures.

        The technical features of the independent claims may not be presented as
        optional in the description. Where they precede a feature of an independent claim,
        terms such as "for example", "may", "can", "exemplary , optionally , preferably"
        and the like must be removed.

        "CIaim-Iike" clauses must be deleted prior to grant (Summary, page 1, line 19 to
        page 4, line 14). CIaim-Iike clauses are clauses present in the description which
        use claim language such as "according to the preceding clause" or "characterised
        in that" (Guidelines F-IV, 4.4). CIaim-Iike clauses include examples, embodiments
        or aspects which are presented as claim-Iike clauses. The simple conversion of
        these clauses into separate optional features will not be admitted either.
