                                             CLAIMS

         1. A device discovery method, wherein the method comprises:

         displaying, by a first device, a first interface provided by a first application, wherein at least

    one control is displayed in the first interface;

         detecting, by the first device, M second devices, wherein the second device comprises a device

    that is located in a same network as the first device, and/or a device that logs in to a same user

    account as the first device;

         displaying, by the first device, identifiers of N second devices in response to an operation

    performed on one of the at least one control, wherein the N second devices comprise a second

    device, in the M second devices, on which a second application is installed, and the second

10 application and the first application provide a same resource; wherein

              the N second devices specifically comprise a second device on which a second application

         of preset version is installed in the M second devices; or

              the N second devices specifically comprise a second device on which the second

         application and an operating system of preset version are installed in the M second devices;

15       and

         detecting, by the first device, a first operation performed on one of the identifiers of the N

    second devices, and invoking a resource of a second device corresponding to the identifier on

    which the first operation is performed.

20       2. The method according to claim 1, wherein before the detecting, by the first device, M

    second devices, the method further comprises: detecting, by the first device, a second operation.

              3. The method according to claim 1 or 2, wherein the displaying, by the first device, identifiers
        of N second devices specifically comprises: displaying, by the first device, a second interface
25 provided by the first application, wherein the identifiers of the N second devices are displayed in
         the second interface.

         4. The method according to any one of claims 1 to 3, wherein the resource comprises at least

    one of an image, a service, a capability, and hardware.

3O

         5. The method according to any one of claims 1 to 4, wherein the resource comprises an image;

    and

         the invoking a resource of a second device corresponding to the identifier on which the first

    operation is performed specifically comprises:

35       displaying a third interface provided by the first application, and displaying, in the third

                                                      1
        interface, an image of the second device corresponding to the identifier on which the first
        operation is performed.

               6. The method according to any one of claims 1 to 4, wherein the resource is a camera (193);
        and

              the invoking a resource of a second device corresponding to the identifier on which the first
        operation is performed specifically comprises:

              displaying a fourth interface provided by the first application, and displaying, in the fourth
        interface, an image that is captured by a camera (193) of the second device corresponding to the
10 identifier on which the first operation is performed.

              7. The method according to any one of claims 1 to 6, wherein the method further comprises:
              skipping displaying, by the first device, an identifier of a second device on which the second
        application is not installed.
15
               8. An electronic device (100, 200, 300, 400, 671, 672, 731, 821), comprising one or more
        processors and one or more memories, wherein the one or more memories are coupled to the one
        or more processors, the one or more memories are configured to store computer program code,
        the computer program code comprises computer instructions, and when the one or more
20 processors execute the computer instructions, the method according to any one of claims 1 to 7 is
        performed.

              9. A computer program product comprising instructions, wherein when the computer
         program product runs on an electronic device (100, 200, 300, 400, 671, 672, 731, 821), the
25 electronic device (100, 200, 300, 400, 671, 672, 731, 821) is enabled to perform the method
        according to any one of claims 1 to 7.

              10. A computer-readable storage medium, comprising instructions, wherein when the
         instructions are run on an electronic device (100, 200, 300, 400, 671, 672, 731, 821), the method
3O according to any one of claims 1 to 7 is performed.
