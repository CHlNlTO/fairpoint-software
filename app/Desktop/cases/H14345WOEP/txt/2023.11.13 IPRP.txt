         [3 D2: CN 110958475 A, 03 April 2020

        [4] D3: CN 104581402 A, 29 Apri12015

        [5] 1. Claim 1 relates to a device discovery method. D1 discloses an application function implementation

                method, and discloses (Claims 1-4): a first electronic device establishing a first Wireless link by using a
                first Wireless communications protocol; the first electronic device displaying a first interface, wherein the
                first interface comprises: a first control associated With data that a user of the first electronic device wants
                to share; in response to the first operation, the first electronic device displaying a shortcut menu, wherein
                the shortcut menu comprises a second control; the first electronic device receiving a second operation for
                the second control; in response to the second operation, the first electronic device displaying a discovery
                device list, wherein the discovery device list comprises an identifier of a second electronic device; the first
                electronic device receiving a third operation for the identifier of the second electronic device; in response
                to the third operation, the first electronic device establishing a second Wireless link With the second
                electronic device by means of a second Wireless communications protocol, wherein the first electronic
                  device and the second electronic device are associated With each other; and the first electronic device
                sending first information to the second electronic device by means of the second Wireless link, wherein the
                first information comprises data to be shared and an identifier, and the identifier is used for indicating an
                application module.

        [6] Comparing Claim 1 With D1, the differences lie in: (1) the first device detecting M second devices, wherein

                each second device comprises: a device in the same network as the first device, and/or a device logging in
                t0 the same user account as the first device; and (2) the N second devices comprising the M second devices
                installed With a second application program among the M second devices; the second application program
                and the first application program providing the same resource; and the first device calling a resource of
                a second device corresponding to an identifier on Which the first operation acts. The technical problems
                actually to be solved thereby are: (1) the specific means for selecting a discovery device; and (2) the
                specific interaction means after a device is discovered. Therefore, Claims 1-8 comply With PCT Article
                33(2).

                  With regard to difference (1), D2 discloses the same features (as provided in Claim 12) and provides the
                  motivation for combination.

                With regard to difference (2), D3 discloses (description, paragraphs [0047]-[0049]): determining Whether
                there is an input device and corresponding software in each second electronic device and Whether the
                second electronic device can interact With a first electronic device. Furthermore, calling a resource is
                merely a selection of customary means.

                In summary, it would have been obvious to arrive at Claim 1 by combining D1-D3 and the above-
                mentioned customary means. Therefore, Claim 1 does not comply With PCT Article 33(3).

       [10] 2. With regard to Claims 2-8, the additional features of Claim 2 are disclosed in D3 (see description,

                paragraph [0055]).

BOX NO' V  Reasoned statement under Rule 43bis.1(a)(i) with regard to novelty, inventive step and industrial applicability;
           citations and explanations supporting such statement

[ 11] The third operation of D1 is the second operation of Claim 3.

[ 12] The additional features of Claim 4 are disclosed in D1 (see the comments on Claim 1).

[13] The additional features of Claims 5-8 are customary means.

[14] Therefore, Claims 2-8 do not comply With PCT Article 33(3).

[ 15] 6. On the basis of similar reasoning, Claims 9-11 comply With PCT Article 33(2), but do not comply With

       PCT Article 33(3).

[16] 7. Claims 1-11 are industrially applicable and comply With PCT Article 33(4).
