                        LLC [US]) 17 March 2016 (2016-03-17)

1        Executive Summary
1.1
         Claim 1 on file corresponds to former claim 1 adding the subject matter of
1.1.1    former dependent claim 2; besides 1 editorial amendment has been made
1.2      resulting in now reading, in the claim, " ... wherein the N second devices
1.3      comprise a second device, in the M second devices, on which a second
2        application is installed, ... "

2.1      Former claim 1 is the originally filled claim 1 which, in its turn, corresponds to
         the English translation of the PCT published claim 1.

         There is a clarity issue in claim 1, concerning "a second application" see section

         3.1.

         In so far the claim can be understood, it is considered not inventive in view of

         D1, see section 2.

         Inventive Step of independent claims (Art. 52(1) and 56 EPC)

         Furthermore, notwithstanding the below-mentioned lack of clarity, the subject-
         matter of claim 1 does not involve an inventive step within the meaning of Article
         56 EPC, and the requirements of Article 52(1) EPC are therefore not met.

2.1.1  Claim 1 on file corresponds with former claim 1 adding the subject matter of
       former dependent claim 2 (see section 1.1). In the previous action of the office
       (search of the application) claim 2 was considered obvious in view of D1. In his
       letter dated 02.01.2025 the applicant arguments why the features of former
       claim 2 are new and inventive; this is respectfully disagreed.

       In the ESOP, when mapping D1 to the feature of former (and current) claim 1
       "displaying, by the first device, identifiers of N second devices in
       response to an operation performed on one of the at least one control,
       wherein the N second devices comprise a second device on which a
       second application is installed in the M second devices, and the second
       application and the first application provide a same resource; and"
       paragraphs 108-117 of D1 were cited those reading:
       (paragraph [00108] - paragraph [00117]: At block 606 the model remote control
       module on the source device can send an application discovery query message
       to one or more trusted remote devices. The application discovery query can
       include a request for application capability data on the one or more trusted
       devices, including the ability of an application to perform a particular task, the
       speed of an application, and/or other application performance data. The
       application discovery query can further include a request for device capability
       data, such as device memory, speed, and/or display capability, for the one or
       more trusted devices.)
       (paragraph [00108] - paragraph [00117]: At block 608, responsive to the
       application discovery query, the model remote control module on the source
       device receives a discovery response message. The discovery response
       message can include an indication of at least one application capable of
       performing the task on the one or more trusted remote devices, application
       capabilities for the at least one application, and/or device capabilities for the one
       or more trusted remote devices. In some examples, the one or more discovery
       response messages can include a notification that a remote device and/or
       application on a remote device is not capable of executing the task.
       At block 610, the model remote control module on the source device can
       receive a plurality of discovery response messages. A remote application
       discovery client can process the plurality of discovery response messages, and
       send remote application files to a remote application file limiter, such as remote
       application file limiter 408.)

         Current claim 1 adds the features of former claim 2 (see 3.1) which add further
         limitations to the second device via further limiting the second application with
         an alternative with two options: "wherein the N second devices specifically
         comprise a second device on which a second application of preset
         version is installed in the M second devices; or the N second devices
         specifically comprise a second device on which the second application
         and an operating system of preset version are installed in the M second
         devices;"

         From the applicant's letter dated 02.01.2025, this feature mapping does not

          seem contested.
         The applicant derives a technical effect from the added feature to claim 1

         (coming from former claim 2) and also the corresponding technical problem:
         "The distinguishing features have the technical effect that only those devices
         which have the necessary software compatibility are included in the filtered list
         of devices. This filtering mechanism based on either application versions or both
         application and operating system versions guarantees that the selected devices
         can reliably support the functionalities required by the first application, thereby
         ensuring a seamless and improved user experience.

          Therefore, the objective technical problem can be seen in how to improve a
         user experience when working with multiple devices. ; "

         The skilled person, departing from D1 and faced to the above mentioned
         problem, knows that, to ensure compatibility between devices and applications,
         application and device capabilities need to be taken into account and D1 does
         take this into account as per the mentioned paragraphs (paragraph [00108] -
         paragraph [00117]). That the application capability is designed to further
         explicitly include the application's version is commonly known since version
         compatibility of applications is a commonly present problem to the public.
         Therefore, the skilled person, departing from D1 and faced to the above
         mentioned problem, would find natural to enhance D1 with this obvious (if not
         implicit feature) of considering also application version among application's
         capabilities, therefore arriving, without exercising any inventive skills to the
         solution of the claim (1st option of the alternative present in the claim).

3 Clarity, conciseness and support (Art. 84 EPC)

3.1 Claim 1 reads: "
         A device discovery method, wherein the method comprises:

                       ...

          displaying, by the first device, identifiers of N second devices in response to an
          operation performed on one of the at least one control, wherein the N second
          devices comprise a second device, in the M second devices, on which a second
          application is installed, and the second application and the first application
          provide a same resource; wherein
          the N second devices specifically comprise a second device on which a second
          application of preset version is installed in the M second devices; or
         the N second devices specifically comprise a second device on which the
         second application and an operating system of preset version are installed in
          the M second devices;"

         So, when reading "second device on which a second application of preset
          version is installed in the M second devices; " it is not known if the "a second
         application" refers to the previous second application in "on which a second
         application is installed,".

3.1.1 The claim has been interpreted in the lines of "the N second devices specifically
          comprise a second device on which the second application is further of a preset
          version", see section 2

3.1.2 Note that the feature in question is originally from dependent claim 2 (see
         section 1.1) and this deficiency should have already been identified in the
          previous action of the office.

3.2 Claim 1 reads: "

          wherein the N second devices comprise a second device, in the M second
         devices, on which a second application is installed, and the second application
          and the first application provide a same resource;
          wherein the N second devices specifically comprise a second device on which a
          second application of preset version is installed in the M second devices;
         or the N second devices specifically comprise a second device on which the
         second application and an operating system of preset version are installed in
          the M second devices;"

         To harmonise the drafting of the claim and make it more understandable, it is
         suggested to draft it (see also section 3.1) as: "
         wherein the N second devices specifically comprise a second device, in the M

   second devices, on which a second application of preset version is installed;
   or the N second devices specifically comprise a second device, in the M second
   devices, on which the second application and an operating system of preset
   version are installed;"

4  Further Objections

4.1 The features of the claims should be provided with reference signs placed in
         parentheses to increase the intelligibility of the claims (Rule 43(7) EPC). This
         applies to both the preamble and characterising portion (see EPC Guidelines F-
         IV, 4.18).

4.2 The statement in the description, page 1, 1st paragraph, concerning the
         incorporation of cited document by reference should be removed (GL. Part F,
         Chapter III-8).
