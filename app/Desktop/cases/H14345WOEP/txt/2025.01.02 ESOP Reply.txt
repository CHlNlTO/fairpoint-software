All claims have been re-numbered appropriately.
All claims have been provided with reference signs, where appropriate.
The description has been amended to acknowledge the prior art known from document
D1. Furthermore, the description has been amended to reflect the amended claims.
Thus, all amendments meet the requirements of Alt. 123(2) EPC.
II. Clarity
In Section 1.1 of the European Search Opinion (ESOP), the Search Division argues that
the expression "the N second devices comprise a second device on which a second
application is installed in the M second devices" is not clear.
To proceed with the application in a favorable manner, claim 1 has been rephrased in the
manner suggested by the Search Division in Section 1.1.
Thus, at least all new claims meet the requirements of Art. 84 EPC.
III. Novelty and Inventive Step
As seemingly conceded by the Search Division in Section 3.2 of the ESOP, D1 does not
disclose:
a) the N second devices specifically comprise a second device on which a second

         application ofpreset version is installed in the M second devices,
b) the N second devices specifically comprise a second device on which the second

         application and an operating system of preset version are installed in the M
         second devices.
Thus, the subject matter of claim 1 is new. The same considerations apply mutatis
mutandis to claims 8, 9 and 10.
D1 is considered as closest prior art. D1 does not disclose the above-mentioned
distinguishing features.
The distinguishing features have the technical effect that only those devices which have
the necessary software compatibility are included in the filtered list of devices. This
filtering mechanism based on either application versions or both application and

                                                                                                                                                                                  2/4
                                                   g8 BOEHMERT & BOEHMERT

operating system versions guarantees that the selected devices can reliably support the
functionalities required by the first application, thereby ensuring a seamless and
improved user experience.

Therefore, the objective technical problem can be seen in how to improve a user
experience when working with multiple devices.

The Search Division in Section 3.1 of the ESOP argues that the distinguishing features
are obvious from D1.

The applicant respectfully disagrees.

Starting from D1, the skilled person with the obj ective technical problem in mind would
find no hints towards the distinguishing features. Instead, D1 focuses primarily on
application and device capability data. Specifically, par. [0112] of D1, as cited by the
Search Division, discloses that application capability data comprises "ability of an
application to perform the particular task, the speed of an application, and/or other
application performance data" and device capability data comprises "device memory,
speed, and/or display capability".

Therefore, starting from D1, the skilled person would be guided away from the
distinguishing features and would, at best, arrive at an alternative solution where
applications and devices with the most appropriate performance capabilities are
selected. However, this would be significantly different from the claimed subject matter,
which focuses on selecting devices based on either a preset version of an application or a
preset version of an application and an operating system.

Thus, starting from D1, the skilled person would not arrive at the present invention.

The same considerations apply mutatis mutandis to claims 8, 9 and 10, which therefore
also rely on an inventive step.

IV. Conclusion

In view of the amendments made and the above explanations, it is believed that the
application is now in a state acceptable for grant. Should the Examining Division,
nevertheless, still see deficiencies in the documents on file, it is kindly asked to give the
applicant the opportunity to file further arguments and, if necessary, amendments.
Minor issues could be discussed by telephone.

Only as a measure of precaution,

                                                                                                                                                                                 3/4
