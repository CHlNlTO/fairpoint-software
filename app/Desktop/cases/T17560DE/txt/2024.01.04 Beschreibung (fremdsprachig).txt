PRIORITY CLAIM AND CROSS-REFERENCE
[0001] This application claims the benefit of the following provisionally filed U.S. Patent
application: Application No. 63/581,043, filed on September 7, 2023, and entitled
"SELECTIVITY ANISOTROPIC DEPOSITION OF ALTERNATIVE DIELECTRIC METHODS
FOR NANOSHEET LOSS AND STI OXIDE PROTECTION," which application is hereby

BACKGROUND
[0002] Semiconductor devices are used in a variety of electronic applications, such as personal
computers, cell phones, digital cameras, and other electronic equipment. Semiconductor devices
are typically fabricated by sequentially depositing insulating or dielectric layers, conductive
layers, and semiconductor layers of material over a semiconductor substrate, and patterning the
various material layers using lithography to form circuit components and elements thereon.
[0003] The semiconductor industry continues to improve the integration density of various
electronic components (for example, transistors, diodes, resistors, capacitors, etc.) through
continual reduction in minimum feature size, which allows more components to be integrated
into a given area. As the minimum feature sizes are reduced, however, additional problems arise
and should be addressed.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION
[0007] The following disclosure provides many different embodiments, or examples, for
implementing different features of the invention. Specific examples of components and
arrangements are described below to simplify the present disclosure. These are, of course,
merely examples and are not intended to be limiting. For example, the formation of a first
feature over or on a second feature in the description that follows may include embodiments in
which the first and second features are formed in direct contact, and may also include
embodiments in which additional features may be formed between the first and second features,
such that the first and second features may not be in direct contact. In addition, the present
disclosure may repeat reference numerals and/or letters in the various examples. This repetition
is for the purpose of simplicity and clarity and does not in itself dictate a relationship between
the various embodiments and/or configurations discussed.
[0008] Further, spatially relative terms, such as "underlying," "below," "lower," "overlying,"
"upper" and the like, may be used herein for ease of description to describe one element or
feature's relationship to another element(s) or feature(s) as illustrated in the figures. The
spatially relative terms are intended to encompass different orientations of the device in use or
operation in addition to the orientation depicted in the figures. The apparatus may be otherwise

oriented (rotated 90 degrees or at other orientations) and the spatially relative descriptors used
herein may likewise be interpreted accordingly.
[0009] A Gate-All-Around (GAA) transistor with reduced loss in top semiconductor
nanostructure and reduced loss in Shallow Trench Isolation (STI) region, and the respective
methods are provided. In accordance with some embodiments, a first dielectric layer is formed
on a protruding fin using a conformal deposition process. A second dielectric layer is formed on
the first dielectric layer using an anisotropic deposition process. The second dielectric layer is
used as a hard mask, and is on the top surface, but may not be on the sidewalls, of the
protruding fin. The second dielectric layer thus may be formed with the top portion being
thicker to provide better protection without occupying the space between neighboring
protruding fins. It is appreciated that although GAA transistors are used as examples, other
types of transistors such as Fin Field-Effect Transistors (FinFETs) may also adopt the
embodiments of the present disclosure.
[0010] Embodiments discussed herein are to provide examples to enable making or using the
subject matter of this disclosure, and a person having ordinary skill in the art will readily
understand modifications that can be made while remaining within contemplated scopes of
different embodiments. Throughout the various views and illustrative embodiments, like
reference numbers are used to designate like elements. Although method embodiments may be
discussed as being performed in a particular order, other method embodiments may be
performed in any logical order.
[0011] Figures 1-3, 4A, 4B, 5, 6A, 6B, 6C, 7, 8A, 8B, 8C, 9A, 9B, 10A, 10B, 11A, 11B, 11C, 12A,
12B, 13A, 13B, 14A, 14B, 15A, 15B, 15C, and 15D illustrate the views of f intermediate stages in
the formation of a GAA transistor in accordance with some embodiments. The corresponding
processes are also reflected schematically in the process flow shown in Figure 16.
[0012] Referring to Figure 1, a perspective view of wafer 10 is shown, which includes substrate
20. A multilayer structure comprising multilayer stack 22 is formed on substrate 20. In
2024010408564500DE 04.01.2024 DPMADirekt
T17560DE
4
accordance with some embodiments, substrate 20 is or comprises a semiconductor substrate,
which may be a silicon substrate, a silicon germanium (SiGe) substrate, or the like, while other
substrates and/or structures, such as semiconductor-on-insulator (SOI), strained SOI, silicon
germanium on insulator, or the like, could be used. Substrate 20 may be doped as a p-type
semiconductor, although in other embodiments, it may be doped as an n-type semiconductor.
[0013] In accordance with some embodiments, multilayer stack 22 is formed through a series
of epitaxy processes for depositing alternating materials. The respective process is illustrated as
process 202 in the process flow 200 as shown in Figure 16. In accordance with some
embodiments, multilayer stack 22 comprises first layers 22A formed of a first semiconductor
material and second layers 22B formed of a second semiconductor material different from the
first semiconductor material. Due to the epitaxy, the first layers 22A and the second layers 22B
have the same lattice orientations as substrate 20.
[0014] In accordance with some embodiments, the first semiconductor material of a first layer
22A is formed of or comprises SiGe, Ge, Si, GaAs, InSb, GaSb, InAlAs, InGaAs, GaSbP, GaAsSb,
or the like. In accordance with some embodiments, the deposition of first layers 22A (for
example, SiGe) is through epitaxial growth, and the corresponding deposition method may be
Vapor-Phase Epitaxy (VPE), Molecular Beam Epitaxy (MBE), Chemical Vapor deposition
(CVD), Low Pressure CVD (LPCVD), Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD), Ultra High Vacuum CVD
(UHVCVD), Reduced Pressure CVD (RPCVD), or the like.
[0015] Once the first layer 22A has been deposited over substrate 20, a second layer 22B is
deposited over the first layer 22A. In accordance with some embodiments, the second layers 22B
is formed of or comprises a second semiconductor material such as Si, SiGe, Ge, GaAs, InSb,
GaSb, InAlAs, InGaAs, GaSbP, GaAsSb, combinations of these, or the like, with the second
semiconductor material being different from the first semiconductor material of first layer 22A.
For example, in accordance with some embodiments in which the first layer 22A is silicon
germanium, the second layer 22B may be formed of silicon, or vice versa. It is appreciated that
2024010408564500DE 04.01.2024 DPMADirekt
T17560DE

any suitable combination of materials may be utilized for first layers 22A and the second layers
22B.
[0016] In accordance with some embodiments, the second layer 22B is epitaxially grown on
the first layer 22A using a deposition technique similar to that is used to form the first layer 22A.
In accordance with some embodiments, the second layer 22B is formed to a similar thickness to
that of the first layer 22A. The second layer 22B may also be formed to a thickness that is
different from the first layer 22A.
[0017] In accordance with some embodiments, first layers 22A are removed in the subsequent
processes, and are alternatively referred to as sacrificial layers 22A throughout the description.
In accordance with alternative embodiments, second layers 22B are sacrificial, and are removed
in the subsequent processes.
[0018] In accordance with some embodiments, pad oxide layer 12 and hard mask layer 14 are
formed over multilayer stack 22. Pad oxide layer 12 may comprise silicon oxide, silicon carbide,
or the like, while hard mask layer 14 may comprise silicon nitride, and other materials may be
used. Pad oxide layer 12 and hard mask layer 14 are patterned to form a plurality of elongated
strips, which are also referred to as pad oxides and hard masks.
[0019] Referring to Figure 2, multilayer stack 22 and a portion of the underlying substrate 20
are patterned in an etching process(es), so that trenches (filled with isolation regions 26) are
formed. The trenches extend into substrate 20. The remaining portions of multilayer stacks are
referred to as multilayer stacks 22' hereinafter. The respective process is illustrated as process
204 in the process flow 200 as shown in Figure 16. Underlying multilayer stacks 22', some
portions of substrate 20 are left, and are referred to as substrate strips 20' hereinafter.
Multilayer stacks 22' include semiconductor layers 22A and 22B. Semiconductor layers 22A are
alternatively referred to as sacrificial layers, and semiconductor layers 22B are alternatively
referred to as nanostructures hereinafter. The portions of multilayer stacks 22' and the
underlying substrate strips 20' are collectively referred to as semiconductor strips 24.

[0020] In above-illustrated embodiments, the GAA transistor structures may be patterned by
any suitable method. For example, the structures may be patterned using one or more
photolithography processes, including double-patterning or multi-patterning processes.
Generally, double-patterning or multi-patterning processes combine photolithography and self-
aligned processes, allowing patterns to be created that have, for example, pitches smaller than
what is otherwise obtainable using a single, direct photolithography process. For example, in
one embodiment, a sacrificial layer is formed over a substrate and patterned using a
photolithography process. Spacers are formed alongside the patterned sacrificial layer using a
self-aligned process. The sacrificial layer is then removed, and the remaining spacers may then
be used to pattern the GAA structure.
[0021] Next, isolation regions 26 are formed, which may also be referred to as Shallow Trench
Isolation (STI) regions throughout the description. The respective process is illustrated as
process 206 in the process flow 200 as shown in Figure 16. STI regions 26 may include a liner
oxide (not shown), which may be a thermal oxide formed through the thermal oxidation of a
surface layer of substrate 20. The liner oxide may also be a deposited silicon oxide layer formed
using, for example, ALD, High-Density Plasma Chemical Vapor Deposition (HDPCVD), CVD, or
the like. STI regions 26 may also include a dielectric material over the liner oxide, wherein the
dielectric material may be formed using Flowable Chemical Vapor Deposition (FCVD), spin-on
coating, HDPCVD, or the like. A planarization process such as a Chemical Mechanical Polish
(CMP) process or a mechanical grinding process may then be performed to level the top surface
of the dielectric material, for example, with the top surface of hard mask layer 14, and the
remaining portions of the dielectric material are STI regions 26.
[0022] Further referring to Figure 3, STI regions 26 are recessed, so that the top portions of
semiconductor strips 24 protrude higher than the top surfaces 26T of the remaining portions of
STI regions 26 to form protruding fins (structures) 28. The respective process is illustrated as
process 208 in the process flow 200 as shown in Figure 16. Protruding fins 28 include multilayer
2024010408564500DE 04.01.2024 DPMADirekt
T17560DE
7
stacks 22' and some top portions of substrate strips 20'. The recessing of STI regions 26 may be
performed through a dry etching process, wherein NF3
and NH3
, for example, are used as the
etching gases. During the etching process, plasma may be generated. Argon may also be
included. In accordance with alternative embodiments of the present disclosure, the recessing of
STI regions 26 is performed through a wet etching process. The etching chemical may include
HF, for example. Pad oxide layers 12 and hard masks 14 are removed.
[0023] Referring to Figures 4A and 4B, composite dielectric layer 32, which includes dielectric
layer 32A and dielectric layer 32B, is formed. The respective process is illustrated as process 210
in the process flow 200 as shown in Figure 16. Dielectric layer 32A is deposited on the sidewalls
and the top surfaces of protruding fins 28, and on the top surfaces of STI regions 26. Figure 4A
illustrates a perspective view, and Figure 4B illustrates the vertical cross-section 4B - 4B as
shown in Figure 4A.
[0024] In accordance with some embodiments, dielectric layer 32A is a single (homogeneous)
layer, with an entirety of dielectric layer 32A being formed of a same material and having a same
composition. Throughout the description, when two layers are referred to as having the same
composition, it indicates that the two layers have same elements, and the percentages of the
corresponding elements in two layers are the same as each other. Conversely, when two layers
are referred to as having different compositions, it indicates that at least one of the two layers
either has at least one element not in the other layer, or the two layers have the same elements,
but the percentages of the elements in two layers are different from each other. In accordance
with alternative embodiments, dielectric layer 32A is a composite layer including two or more
sub layers.
[0025] In accordance with some embodiments, dielectric layer 32A is formed using a
conformal deposition process, so that the vertical portions (also referred to as sidewall portions)
and horizontal portions (also referred to as top portions) of dielectric layer 32A have a same
thickness, for example, with a variation smaller than about 20 percent, smaller than about 10
2024010408564500DE 04.01.2024 DPMADirekt
T17560DE
8
percent, or lower. The formation is performed through a conformal formation process such as
ALD, CVD, or the like. The materials of dielectric layer 32A may include an oxide such as silicon
oxide, silicon oxynitride, silicon oxycarbide, or the like.
[0026] Dielectric layer 32B is then deposited on dielectric layer 32A using a non-conformal
deposition process, which is also referred to as an anisotropic deposition process. Dielectric
layers 32A and 32B are collectively referred to as composite dielectric layers 32 hereinafter.
Dielectric layer 32B is also referred to as a hard mask layer since it prevents the undesirable
etching in subsequent dummy gate patterning and cleaning processes. As shown in Figures 4A
and 4B, dielectric layer 32B may include horizontal portions over the top surface of protruding
fins 28 and STI regions 26. Dielectric layer 32B may be free, or substantially free, from vertical
portions on sidewalls of protruding fins 28.
[0027] In accordance with alternative embodiments, dielectric layer 32B may include vertical
portions on the sidewalls of protruding fins 28. The thickness T2 of the vertical portions,
however, is significantly smaller than the thickness T1 of the horizontal portions. For example,
the ratio T2/T1 may be smaller than about 0.2 or smaller than about 0.1.
[0028] Figure 4B illustrates some example vertical portions of dielectric layer 32B. In
accordance with some embodiments, the sidewalls of the top portions of protruding fins 28 have
dielectric layer 32B thereon. The sidewalls of the bottom portions of protruding fins 28 do not
have dielectric layer 32B thereon, and the corresponding bottom parts of dielectric layer 32A is
exposed. In accordance with alternative embodiments, the vertical portions of dielectric layer
32B cover all of the sidewall portions of dielectric layer 32A, with thickness T2 being smaller
than thickness T1.
[0029] Since the deposition of dielectric layer 32B is anisotropic, thinner or no vertical
portions of the dielectric layer 32B will be formed between the closely located protruding fins 28
to cause the reduction of process window.

[0030] In accordance with some embodiments, dielectric layer 32B may be formed of a
material different from that of dielectric layer 32A. For example, dielectric layer 32A may be
formed of or comprise SiC, SiCN, SiN, SiO, SiOCN,
SiON, or the like, or combinations thereof. It
is noted that the value ranges are examples, and may be different than provided herein.
[0031] In accordance with alternative embodiments, dielectric layers 32A and 32B have the
same elements such as Si, O, and N, or Si, O, C, and N, but have different percentages of the
corresponding elements as deposited, and/or after subsequent thermal processes. For example,
the atomic percentages of C and/or N in dielectric layer 32B may be higher than that of
dielectric layer 32A, and the atomic percentage of O in dielectric layer 32A may be higher than
that of dielectric layer 32B.
[0032] In accordance with yet alternative embodiments, dielectric layer 32B is a composite
layer including a lower sub layer and an upper sub layer (referred to as sub layers 32B1 and
32B2, not shown). Sub layers 32B1 and 32B2 are illustrated for one dielectric layer 32B, while
they may be in each of the illustrated portions of dielectric layer 32B. Each of sub layers 32B1
and 32B2 may be formed of or comprise a dielectric material different from the dielectric
material of dielectric layer 32A. While the material of sub layers 32B1 and 32B2 are different
from each other, each of sub layers 32B1 and 32B2 may be formed of the material (as
aforementioned) that has the lower etching rate than that of dielectric layer 32A in the
subsequent patterning and cleaning of dummy gate electrodes 34. For example, each of the sub
layers 32B1 and 32B2 may be selected from the same group of candidate materials, which may
include SiC, SiOC, SiON, SiCN, SiN, SiOCN, or the like.
[0033] In accordance with yet alternative embodiments in which dielectric layer 32B is a
composite layer, each of sub layers 32B1 and 32B2 may have a uniform composition. When
dielectric layer 32B is a single layer, the entirety of dielectric layer 32B may be deposited as
having a uniform composite. In accordance with alternative embodiments, dielectric layer 32B
has a gradually changed composition, with different parts including the same elements (such as
2024010408564500DE 04.01.2024 DPMADirekt
T17560DE
10
silicon, oxygen, and nitrogen), while from bottom to top, the percentage of the elements are
gradually changed. For example, the bottom portion of dielectric layer 32B may comprise SiOx
,
while the top portion may include SiAEy
(or SiOAEy
) wherein "AE" represents an alternative
element(s) such as C and/or N. From the bottom of dielectric layer 32B to the top of dielectric
layer 32B, the atomic percentages y of element AE increase gradually. This may be achieved, for
example, by gradually changing the flow rates of precursors when CVD is used.
[0034] In accordance with some embodiments, dielectric layer 32 is formed using a first
precursor and a second precursor. The first precursor includes a silicon-containing precursor,
which may include silane, di-silane, aminosilanes, di-sec-butylaminosilane (DSBAS), bis(tert-
butylamino)silane (BTBAS), or the like, or combinations thereof. The second precursor may
include other elements such as C, N, and/or O, and may be referred to as O/C/N-containing
precursors hereinafter. For example, the second precursor may comprise ammonia when N is to
be included in dielectric layer.
[0035] In accordance with some embodiments, dielectric layer 32B is formed using an
anisotropic deposition process such as a Plasma Enhanced Atomic Layer Deposition (PEALD)
process, in which plasma is generated. During the PEALD deposition process, a bias power is
added. The bias power, when added, may be greater than about 150 watts, and may be in the
range between about 10 watts and about 500 watts.
[0036] The plasma may be applied during and/or after the pulsing of the precursors such as
the silicon-containing precursor and the O/C/N-containing precursor, and may be applied, for
example, after the purging of one precursor and before the pulsing of the next precursor. For
example, plasma may be turned off during the pulsing of the silicon-containing precursor, and is
turned on at a time after the pulsing of the silicon-containing precursor and before the pulsing
of the O/C/N-containing precursor. Similarly, plasma may be turned off during the pulsing of
the O/C/N-containing precursor, and is turned on at a time after the pulsing of the O/C/N-
2024010408564500DE 04.01.2024 DPMADirekt
T17560DE
11
containing precursor and before the pulsing of the silicon-containing precursor. The plasma
may be generated from the purging gas such as argon, N2
, or the like.
[0037] With the using of the PEALD and the adoption of the bias power, the dielectric layer
32B is non-conformal, with the thickness T1 of the horizontal portions being greater than the
thickness T2 of the vertical portions. To further enhance the anisotropic deposition effect, the
process conditions of the PEALD is adjusted to ensure that the deposition is in diffusion mode.
The diffusion mode may be achieved and enhanced by reducing the pulsing time (feed time),
reducing purging time, and reducing the plasma treatment time. Also, the diffusion mode may
be enhanced by increasing the chamber pressure during the pulsing of the precursors, and/or
when the plasma is turned on.
[0038] In accordance with some embodiments, the pulsing time (feed time) of each of the
precursors may be in the range between about 0.01 seconds and about 0.2 seconds. This is
shorter than that of the typical non-diffusion mode deposition in which the pulsing time may be
in the range between about 0.2 seconds and about 3 second. The plasma treatment time of each
of the precursors may be in the range between about 0. 1 seconds and about 0.3 seconds. This is
shorter than that of the typical non-diffusion mode deposition in which the plasma treatment
time may be in the range between about 0.3 seconds and about 2 second. The purging time of
each of the precursors may be reduced to be in the range between about 0.5 seconds and about
1.5 seconds.
[0039] In accordance with alternative embodiments, dielectric layer 32B is deposited using
Physical Vapor Deposition (PVD), with bias power being applied to achieve the anisotropic
deposition. For example, the bias power may be in the range between about 1,000 watts and
about 3,000 watts.
[0040] Referring to Figure 5, dummy gate electrode layer 34 is deposited. The respective
process is illustrated as process 212 in the process flow 200 as shown in Figure 16. A
planarization process is then performed to level the top surface of dummy gate electrode layer
2024010408564500DE 04.01.2024 DPMADirekt
T17560DE
12
34. Dummy gate electrode layer 34 may be formed, for example, using polysilicon or amorphous
silicon, and other materials such as amorphous carbon may also be used. One (or a plurality of)
hard mask layer 36 is also formed over dummy gate electrode layer 34. Hard mask layers 36
may be formed of silicon nitride, silicon oxide, silicon carbo-nitride, silicon oxy-carbo nitride, or
multilayers thereof.
[0041] Referring to Figures 6A, 6B, and 6C, hard mask layer 36 and dummy gate electrode
layer 34 are patterned to form dummy gate stacks 37, which include hard masks 36 and dummy
gate electrodes 34. The respective process is illustrated as process 214 in the process flow 200 as
shown in Figure 16. Figures 6B and 6C illustrate the vertical cross-sections 6B-6B and 6C-6C,
respectively, in Figure 6A. In accordance with some embodiments, the patterning process is
performed through an anisotropic etching process. The etching gas may include an oxygen
containing gas such as the mixture of HBr, Cl2
, and O2
, or may include other process gases such
as fluorine (F2
), Chlorine (Cl2
), hydrogen chloride (HCl), hydrogen bromide (HBr), Bromine
(Br2
), C2
F6
, CF4
, SO2
, O2
, or combinations thereof. The etching is performed using dielectric
layer 32B as the etch stop layer.
[0042] Subsequently, cleaning processes may be performed. The cleaning may be performed
using a cleaning chemical such as diluted HF. In accordance with some embodiments, by
selecting proper combination of the material of dielectric layer 32B, the chemical for the
patterning of dummy gate electrode layer 34, and the cleaning chemical, the etching (loss) rate
of dielectric layer 32B (during the patterning and the cleaning) is lower than the etching rate of
dielectric layer 32A, which may comprise silicon oxide. For example, the etching rate
ER32B
/ER32A
may be greater than about 5 or greater than about 10, wherein ER32B
is the etching
rate of dielectric layer 32B, and ER32A
is the etching rate of dielectric layer 32A. As a result, the
dielectric layer 32B in the embodiments of the present disclosure stops the etching better than
silicon oxide, which may also be the gate oxides of IO transistors (which may be formed in the
same wafer/die as the GAA transistors).
2024010408564500DE 04.01.2024 DPMADirekt
T17560DE
13
[0043] With the top portions of dielectric layer 32A being thicker and more resistance to the
etching and cleaning, the possibility of the full removal of the top portion of dielectric layer 32B
in the patterning process is reduced. Accordingly, the underlying top nanostructure 22B is less
likely to be etched, or the loss is less if etched. The re-oxidation of the top nanostructure 22B,
which is also referred to as a top sheet, is reduced, and the loss of the top sheet is reduced.
[0044] In the etching and the cleaning process, the vertical portions (Figures 6B and 6C) of
dielectric layer 32 may also be thinned. In accordance with some embodiments, the vertical
portions (if any) of dielectric layer 32B are fully removed due to their very small thickness. In
accordance with alternative embodiments, the vertical portions (if formed) of dielectric layer
32B are thinned but not fully removed.
[0045] Next, as shown in Figure 7, gate spacers 38 are formed on the sidewalls of dummy gate
stacks 37. The respective process is illustrated as process 216 in the process flow 200 as shown
in Figure 16. In accordance with some embodiments, gate spacers 38 are formed of a dielectric
material such as silicon nitride (SiN), silicon oxide (SiO2
), silicon carbo-nitride (SiCN), silicon
oxynitride (SiON), silicon oxy-carbo-nitride (SiOCN), or the like, and may have a single-layer
structure or a multilayer structure including a plurality of dielectric layers. The formation
process of gate spacers 38 may include depositing one or a plurality of dielectric layers, and then
performing an anisotropic etching process(es) on the dielectric layer(s). The remaining portions
of the dielectric layer(s) are gate spacers 38.
[0046] Figures 8A, 8B, and 8C illustrate the formation of recesses 42, from which epitaxy
regions are formed. Figure 8A illustrates the vertical cross-section 8A-8A in Figure 8C, which
cross-section passes through the portions of protruding fins 28 not covered by dummy gate
stacks 37 and gate spacers. Fin spacers 38', which are on the sidewalls of protruding fins 28, are
also illustrated in Figure 8A. Figure 8B illustrates the reference cross-section 8B-8B in Figure
8C, which reference cross-section is parallel to the lengthwise directions of protruding fins 28.

[0047] As shown in Figures 8A, 8B, and 8C, the exposed portions of dielectric layers 32 are
etched. The respective process is illustrated as process 218 in the process flow 200 as shown in
Figure 16. The portions of dielectric layer 32 and protruding fins 28 that are directly underlying
dummy gate stacks 37 and gate spacers 38 remain after the etching process. The respective
process is illustrated as process 220 in the process flow 200 as shown in Figure 16. The
remaining portions of dielectric layer 32 are considered as parts of dummy gate stacks 37. In
accordance with some embodiments, the etching process comprises a dry etch process

, or the like to etch multilayer semiconductor stacks 22' and the underlying substrate
strips 20'. The bottoms of recesses 42 are at least level with, or may be lower than, the bottoms
of multilayer semiconductor stacks 22'. The etching may be anisotropic, so that the sidewalls of
multilayer semiconductor stacks 22' facing recesses 42 are vertical and straight.
[0048] Referring to Figure 8B, sacrificial semiconductor layers 22A are laterally recessed to
form lateral recesses 41, which are recessed from the edges of the respective overlying and
underlying nanostructures 22B. The respective process is illustrated as process 222 in the
process flow 200 as shown in Figure 16. The lateral recessing of sacrificial semiconductor layers
22A may be achieved through a wet etching process using an etchant that is more selective to the
material (for example, silicon germanium (SiGe)) of sacrificial semiconductor layers 22A than
the material (for example, silicon (Si)) of the nanostructures 22B and substrate 20. For example,
in an embodiment in which sacrificial semiconductor layers 22A are formed of silicon
germanium and the nanostructures 22B are formed of silicon, the wet etching process may be
performed using an etchant such as hydrochloric acid (HCl). The wet etching process may be
performed using a dip process, a spray process, or the like. In accordance with alternative
embodiments, the lateral recessing of sacrificial semiconductor layers 22A is performed through
an isotropic dry etching process or a combination of a dry etching process and a wet etching
process.

[0049] Figures 9A and 9B illustrate the formation of inner spacers 44. The respective process
is illustrated as process 224 in the process flow 200 as shown in Figure 16. The formation
process incudes depositing a spacer layer extending into recesses 41, and performing an etching
process to remove the portions of inner spacer layer outside of recesses 41, thus leaving inner
spacers 44 in recesses 41. Inner spacers 44 may be formed of or comprise SiOCN, SiON, SiOC,
SiCN, or the like. accordance with some embodiments, the etching of the spacer layer may be
performed through a wet etching process, in which the etching chemical may include H2SO4
,
diluted HF, ammonia solution (NH4
OH, ammonia in water), or the like, or combinations
thereof.
[0050] Figures 10A and 10B illustrate the cross-sectional views and a perspective view in the
formation source/drain regions 48 in recesses 42 through epitaxy. The respective process is
illustrated as process 226 in the process flow 200 as shown in Figure 16. Source/drain region(s)
may refer to a source or a drain, individually or collectively dependent upon the context. In
accordance with some embodiments, the source/drain regions 48 may exert stress on the
nanostructures 22B, which are used as the channels of the corresponding GAA transistors,
thereby improving performance.
[0051] In accordance with some embodiments, the corresponding transistor is n-type, and
epitaxial source/drain regions 48 are accordingly formed as n-type by doping an n-type dopant.
For example, silicon phosphorous (SiP), silicon carbon phosphorous (SiCP), or the like may be
grown to form epitaxial source/drain regions 48. In accordance with alternative embodiments,
the corresponding transistor is p-type, and epitaxial source/drain regions 48 are accordingly
formed as p-type by doping a p-type dopant. For example, silicon boron (SiB), silicon
germanium boron (SiGeB), or the like may be grown to form epitaxial source/drain regions 48.
After recesses 42 are filled with epitaxy regions 48, the further epitaxial growth of epitaxy
regions 48 causes epitaxy regions 48 to expand horizontally, and facets may be formed. The

further growth of epitaxy regions 48 may also cause neighboring epitaxy regions 48 to merge
with each other.
[0052] After the epitaxy process, epitaxy regions 48 may be further implanted with an n-type
impurity or a p-type impurity to form source and drain regions, which are also denoted using
reference numeral 48. In accordance with alternative embodiments of the present disclosure,
the implantation process is skipped when epitaxy regions 48 are in-situ doped with the n-type
impurity or p-type impurity during the epitaxy, and the epitaxy regions 48 are also source/drain
regions.
[0053] Figures 11A, 11B, and 11C illustrate the cross-sectional views and a perspective view of
the structure after the formation of Contact Etch Stop Layer (CESL) 50 and Inter-Layer
Dielectric (ILD) 52. The respective process is illustrated as process 228 in the process flow 200
as shown in Figure 16. CESL 50 may be formed of silicon oxide, silicon nitride, silicon carbo-
nitride, or the like, and may be formed using CVD, ALD, or the like. ILD 52 may include a
dielectric material formed using, for example, FCVD, spin-on coating, CVD, or any other
suitable deposition method. ILD 52 may be formed of an oxygen-containing dielectric material,
which may be a silicon-oxide based material such as silicon oxide, Phospho-Silicate Glass (PSG),
Boro-Silicate Glass (BSG), Boron-Doped Phospho-Silicate Glass (BPSG), Undoped Silicate Glass
(USG), or the like.
[0054] Figures 12A and 12B through Figures 15A and 15B illustrate the process for forming
replacement gate stacks and contact plugs. In Figures 12A and 12B, a planarization process such
as a CMP process or a mechanical grinding process is performed to level the top surface of ILD
52. In accordance with some embodiments, the planarization process may remove hard masks
36 to reveal dummy gate electrodes 34, as shown in Figure 12A. The respective process is
illustrated as process 230 in the process flow 200 as shown in Figure 16. In accordance with
alternative embodiments, the planarization process may reveal, and is stopped on, hard masks
36. In accordance with some embodiments, after the planarization process, the top surfaces of
2024010408564500DE 04.01.2024 DPMADirekt
T17560DE
17
dummy gate electrodes 34 (or hard masks 36), gate spacers 38, and ILD 52 are level within
process variations.
[0055] Next, in the process shown in Figures 13A and 13B, dummy gate electrodes 34 (and
hard masks 36, if remaining) are removed in one or more etching processes, so that recesses 58
are formed. The respective process is illustrated as process 232 in the process flow 200 as shown
in Figure 16. The portions of the dielectric layer 32B in recesses 58 are exposed.
[0056] In accordance with some embodiments, the removal of dummy gate electrodes 34 may
be performed through a dry and/or wet etching process. For example, when dry etching is
performed, the etching gas may include F2
, Cl2
, HCl, HBr, Br2
, C2
F6
, CF4
, SO2
, or the like, or
combinations thereof.
[0057] Referring to Figures 14A and 14B, the exposed portions of the composite gate
dielectrics 32 are etched. The respective process is illustrated as process 234 in the process flow
200 as shown in Figure 16. The portions of gate dielectrics 32 directly underlying gate spacers
38, on the other hand, are protected from being removed.
[0058] Sacrificial layers 22A are then removed to extend recesses 58 between nanostructures
22B. The respective process is illustrated as process 236 in the process flow 200 as shown in
Figure 16. Sacrificial layers 22A may be removed by performing an isotropic etching process
such as a wet etching process using etchants which are selective to the materials of sacrificial
layers 22A, while nanostructures 22B, substrate 20, STI regions 26, and the remaining gate
dielectrics 32A are relatively un-etched as compared to sacrificial layers 22A. In accordance with
some embodiments in which sacrificial layers 22A include, for example, SiGe, and
nanostructures 22B include, for example, Si or carbon-doped silicon, chemicals such as tetra
methyl ammonium hydroxide (TMAH), ammonium hydroxide (NH4
OH), or the like may be
used to remove sacrificial layers 22A.
[0059] Referring to Figures 15A, 15B, and 15C, gate stacks 70 are formed. The respective
process is illustrated as process 238 in the process flow 200 as shown in Figure 16. Gate

dielectrics 62 are first formed. In accordance with some embodiments, each of gate dielectrics
62 includes an interfacial layer 64 and a high-k dielectric layer 66 on the interfacial layer 64. The
interfacial layer 64 may be formed of or comprise silicon oxide, which may be deposited through
a conformal deposition process such as ALD or CVD. In accordance with some embodiments,
the high-k dielectric layer 66 comprises one or more dielectric layers. For example, high-k
dielectric layer 66 may include a metal oxide or a silicate of hafnium, aluminum, zirconium,
lanthanum, manganese, barium, titanium, lead, and combinations thereof.
[0060] Gate electrodes 68 are formed over gate dielectrics 62. In the formation process,
conductive layers are first formed on high-k dielectric layer 66 to fill the remaining portions of
recesses 58. Gate electrodes 68 may include a metal-containing material such as TiN, TaN, TiAl,
TiAlC, cobalt, ruthenium, aluminum, tungsten, combinations thereof, and/or multilayers
thereof. Gate electrodes 68 may also comprise a filling metal such as cobalt, tungsten, or the
like. Gate dielectrics 62 and gate electrodes 68 also fill the spaces between adjacent ones of
nanostructures 22B, and fill the spaces between the bottom ones of nanostructures 22B and the
underlying substrate strips 20'. After the filling of recesses 58, a planarization process such as a
CMP process or a mechanical grinding process is performed to remove the excess portions of
gate dielectrics 62 and gate electrodes 68, which excess portions are over the top surface of ILD
52. Gate electrodes 68 and gate dielectrics 62 are collectively referred to as gate stacks 70 of the
resulting nano-FETs.
[0061] Next, gate stacks 70 are recessed, so that recesses are formed directly over gate stacks
70 and between opposing portions of gate spacers 38. A gate mask 74 comprising one or more
layers of dielectric materials, such as silicon nitride, silicon oxynitride, or the like, is filled in
each of the recesses, followed by a planarization process to remove excess portions of the
dielectric material extending over ILD 52.
[0062] As further illustrated by Figures 15A and 15B, ILD 76 is deposited over ILD 52 and over
gate masks 74. An etch stop layer (not shown), may be, or may not be, deposited before the
2024010408564500DE 04.01.2024 DPMADirekt

formation of ILD 76. In accordance with some embodiments, ILD 76 is formed through FCVD,
CVD, PECVD, or the like. ILD 76 is formed of a dielectric material, which may be selected from
silicon oxide, PSG, BSG, BPSG, USG, or the like.
[0063] ILD 76, ILD 52, CESL 50, and gate masks 74 are etched to form recesses (occupied by
contact plugs 80A and 80B), through which the epitaxial source/drain regions 48 and gate
stacks 70 are exposed. The recesses may be formed through an anisotropic etching process, such
as RIE, NBE, or the like. Although Figure 15B illustrates that contact plugs 80A and 80B are in a
same cross-section, in various embodiments, contact plugs 80A and 80B may be formed in
different cross-sections, thereby reducing the risk of shorting with each other. After the recesses
are formed, silicide regions 78 are formed over the epitaxial source/drain regions 48. In
accordance with some embodiments, silicide regions 78 are formed through metal deposition
and anneal processes.
[0064] Gate contact plugs 80A and source/drain contact plugs 80B are formed. The respective
process is illustrated as process 240 in the process flow 200 as shown in Figure 16. Gate contacts
80A are over and contacting gate electrodes 68. Source/drain contact plugs 80B are formed over
silicide regions 78. Contact plugs 80A and 80B may each comprise one or more layers, such as a
barrier layer and a filling material. The barrier layer may include titanium, titanium nitride,
tantalum, tantalum nitride, or the like. The filling material may include copper, a copper alloy,
silver, gold, tungsten, cobalt, aluminum, nickel, and/or the like. A planarization process, such as
a CMP process, may be performed to remove excess material from a surface of ILD 76. GAA
transistor 82 is thus formed.
[0065] Both of dielectric layers 32A and 32B may exist in the final GAA transistor 82. A cross-
section 15D-15D (Figure 15C), which passes through gate spacer 38, is shown in Figure 15D.
Dielectric layer 32A may be a conformal layer on a protruding fin, which includes
semiconductor nanostructures 22B and gate stack 70 between neighboring semiconductor
nanostructures 22B. The semiconductor nanostructures 22B and the portions of gate stack 70
2024010408564500DE 04.01.2024 DPMADirekt
T17560DE
20
between neighboring semiconductor nanostructures 22B collectively form a protruding fin
higher than the top surfaces of STI regions 26. Dielectric layer 32B may include a first horizontal
portion over the protruding fin, and a second horizontal portion on the top surface of STI region
26.
[0066] Dielectric layer 32B may not, or may, include sidewall portions on the sidewalls of the
protruding fin. When dielectric layer 32B has sidewall portions, the bottommost ends of the
sidewall portions may be higher than, level with, or lower than the mid-height of the protruding
fin. The sidewall portions of the dielectric layer 32B may be joined with, or may be spaced apart
from, the second horizontal portions of the second dielectric layer 32B, which second horizontal
portions are on the top surface of STI region 26.
[0067] Gate spacer 38 may physically contact a sidewall portion of dielectric layer 32A, and is
physically spaced apart from the top portion of dielectric layer 32A by dielectric layer 32B.
Alternatively, in accordance with some embodiments in which dielectric layer 32B also includes
sidewall portions (with smaller thicknesses than the top portions) on all sidewall portions of the
dielectric layer 32A, gate spacer 38 is fully spaced apart from dielectric layer 32A by dielectric
layer 32B.
[0068] The embodiments of the present disclosure have some advantageous features. By
forming a dielectric layer using an anisotropic deposition process, the dielectric layer has greater
thicknesses on top of protruding fins and STI regions. In the patterning for forming dummy
gates and the subsequent cleaning processes, the dielectric layer acts as a hard mask on a
conformal underlying dielectric layer, so that it may reduce the top sheet loss of the
semiconductor nanostructures, and reduce the loss of STI regions.

patterning is stopped on the second dielectric layer. In an embodiment, the second dielectric
layer comprises a second sidewall portion on the first sidewall portion, and wherein the second
sidewall portion is removed in a cleaning process performed before the forming the gate spacer.
