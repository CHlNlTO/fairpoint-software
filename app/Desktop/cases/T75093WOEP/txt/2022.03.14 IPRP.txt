2. FURTHER ACTION

If a demand for international preliminary examination is made, this opinion will usually be considered to be a

written opinion of the International Preliminary Examining Authority ("IPEA") except that this does not apply where
the applicant chooses an Authority other than this one to be the IPEA and the chosen IPEA has notifed the
International Bureau under Rule 66.1bis(b) that written opinions of this International Searching Authority
will not be so considered.

If this opinion is, as provided above, considered to be a written opinion of the IPEA, the applicant is invited to
submit to the IPEA a written reply together, where appropriate, with amendments, before the expiration of 3 months

from the date of mailing of Form PCT/ISA/220 or before the expiration of 22 months from the priority date,

whichever expires later.

For further options, see Form PCT/ISA/220.

INTERNATIONAL SEARCHING AUTHORITY          PCT/EP2020/074134

    Box No. | Basis of the opinion

1. With regard to the language, this opinion has been established on the basis of:

   IZI the international application in the language in which it was filed.
   III a translation of the international application into , which is the language of a translation furnished for the

          purposes of international search (Rules 12.3(a) and 23.1 (b)).
          This opinion has been established taking into account the rectification of an obvious mistake authorized
           by or notified to this Authority under Rule 91 (Rule 43bis.1(a))

           With regard to any nucleotide and/or amino acid sequence disclosed in the international application, this
          opinion has been established on the basis of a sequence listing:
          a. IZI forming part of the international application as filed:

                     IZI in the form of an Annex C/ST.25 text file.

                     III on paper or in the form of an image file.

           b. III furnished together with the international application under PCT Rule 13ter.1(a) for the purposes of
                     international search only in the form of an Annex C/ST.25 text file.

           0. III furnished subsequent to the international filing date for the purposes of international search only:

                   [I in the form of an Annex C/ST.25 text file (Rule 13ter.1(a)).

                   III on paper or in the form of an image file (Rule 13ter.1(b) and Administrative Instructions, Section
                       713).

           In addition, in the case that more than one version or copy of a sequence listing has been filed or furnished,
           the required statements that the information in the subsequent or additional copies is identical to that
           forming part of the application as filed or does not go beyond the application as filed, as appropriate, were
           furnished.

5. Additional comments:

Box No. II Priority

1.|Z|  The validity of the priority claim has not been considered because the International Searching Authority
       does not have in its possession a copy of the earlier application whose priority has been claimed or, where
       required, a translation of that earlier application. This opinion has nevertheless been established on the
       assumption that the relevant date (Rules 43bis.1 and 64.1) is the claimed priority date.

       This opinion has been established as if no priority had been claimed due to the fact that the priority claim
       has been found invalid (Rules 43bis.1 and 64.1). Thus for the purposes of this opinion, the international

       filing date indicated above is considered to be the relevant date.

    If not indicated otherwise the relevant passages are those mentioned in the
    search report.

    Document D1 discloses that circulating DPP3 is increased in patients with
    refractory cardiogenic shock despite vasopressor treatment, compared to
    patients having non-refractory shock.

    Document D2 discloses a method for assessing circulatory DPP3 in patients
    with severe sepsis and septic shock and shows that DPP3 levels increase with
    the severity and the mortality risk.
    Document D3 discloses the use of vasopressors e.g. arginine vasopressin for
    the treatment of refractory shock.
    Document D4 discloses the assessment of pro-adrenomedullin fragment for
    determining the outcome of the treatment with anti-adrenomedullin antibody or
    antibody-fragment.

    Document D5 discloses the use of angiotensin II in the treatment of septic
    shock.

    Novelty (Art. 33 (1) and (2) PCT):

    Document D2 does not explicitly disclose that the DPP3 level is compared to a
    predetermined threshold. However, it is considered that implicitly D2 compares
    the DPP3 levels with values of DPP3 levels in healthy subjects or shock vs
    refractory shock patients. Furthermore, it is noted that this threshold is not
    defined in the claims and it is thus not possible to determine whether the DPP3
    levels are above a threshold (see point 6 below). Therefore, it is considered that
    the disclosure of D2 anticipates the subject-matter of claims 1 and 25. The
    dependent claims 2--4 lack also novelty in view of D2. Claims 5-10 are directed
    to a method of diagnosis and comprise a step which is a method of treatment

           (see point 7 below) which renders the scope of the claims unclear. It is
           considered that this second part relating to a treatment is not a characterizing
          feature. Claims 5-12 lack thus novelty.

3.2 Claims 13 and 17 are directed to a vasopressor for use in the treatment of
           patients identified by a method of claim 1 wherein the DPP3 level is below an
          undefined predetermined threshold. D3 discloses the use of vasopressors e.g.
           arginine vasopressin for the treatment of refractory shock. It appears that the
           group of patients identified by the method of claim 1 does not differ from the
          patients of D3 which have refractory shock. Claim 13 and 17 lack novelty in
           view of D3.

Claims 1-13, 17 and 25 do not meet the requirements of Art.33(2) PCT.

           Inventive step (Art. 33 (1) and (3) PCT):

           Document D2 which is the closest prior art for claims 14 and 18 discloses that
          circulatory DPP3 in patients with severe sepsis and septic shock increases with
          the severity and the mortality risk. Claims 14 and 18 differ in that the DPP3
           inhibitor is used in patients identified by measuring DPP3 levels i.e. having
          refractory shock. The problem to be solved is defined as to provide a treatment
          for refractory shock. The application does not provide any evidence that
           refractory shock is useful for treating patients having refractory shock. The
           problem is thus not solved. In view of D2 showing that DPP3 levels increase
           with the severity of the symptoms in septic shock patients, it would be obvious
          for a skilled person to consider the use of a DPP3 inhibitor to solve the problem.
           Claims 14 and 18 are not inventive.

4.2 The dependent claims 15-16 and 19-21 differ in that the DPP3 inhibitor is
          combined with an angiotensin-receptor-agonist like angiotensin II. The problem
           to be solved is defined as to provide an improved treatment for refractory shock.
           The application does not provide any evidence of an unexpected technical
           effect due to the claimed combinations. The problem is thus redefined as to
          provide an alternative treatment for refractory shock. Vasopressors e.g.
          angiotensin II, are known from D3 and D5 for the treatment of refractory shock.
            It would thus be obvious for a skilled person to combine a DPP3 inhibitor with
           an angiotensin-receptor-agonist like angiotensin II in order to solve the problem.
          Claims 15-16 and 19-21 are not inventive.

4.3 Claims 11-12 and 22-24 differ from D2 in that additionally the level of pro-
          adrenomedullin is assessed and/ an anti-ADM antibody is administered. The
           problem to be solved is to provide an alternative method of diagnosis or method
           of treatment of refractory shook. Document D4 discloses the assessment of pro-
          adrenomedullin fragment for determining the outcome of the treatment with an
           anti-adrenomedullin antibody e.g. in septic shock. In view of the disclosure of
           D1 in combination with D4 a skilled person would have considered to assess
          the level of pro-adrenomedullin in addition to DPP3 and would have envisaged
           the treatment with an anti-adrenomedullin antibody. Claims 11-12 and 22-24 do
           not involve an inventive step.

Claims 10-12 and 13-23 do not meet the requirements of Art. 33(3) PCT.

Certain documents cited
Document D1 is not state of the art as the priority date is valid.

M
Certain observations on the international application

The value of the "predetermined threshold" used in claims 1, 6-14 and 20-25 is
not defined in the claims. It is thus not possible to assess the scope of the
claims. Said claims do not meet the requirements of Art. 6 PCT.

The subject-matter of claims 6-12 is not clear in that said claims are directed to
a method of diagnosis of refractory shook wherein the claims also relate to the
treatment of a patient. The subject-matter of said claims is thus not clear.
