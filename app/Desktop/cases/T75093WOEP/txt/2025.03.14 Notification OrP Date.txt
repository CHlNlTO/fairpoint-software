The submissions made by the applicant on 05.03.2025 have been duly considered.

Oral proceedings are maintained.

The Examining Division considers the feature "a predetermined threshold, that is
between 25 and 150 ng/ml for plasma DPP3" to lack clarity, contrary to the
requirements of Art. 84 EPC, as it results in a constant shifting of the scope of the claim.
For example, when the level is "26", one is at the same time above the threshold value
of 25 but still within the range of between 25 and 150 ng/ml for plasma DPP3.

The Examining Division is however of the opinion that no specific threshold value needs
to be specified in the claims. In fact, as explicitly indicated in the summons, what is
missing is an indication as to how such a threshold value is to be determined.

From the passages on page 18 lines 4-24 (see also page 20 lines 9-13), it can for
example be derived that the predetermined threshold value is obtained by measuring
DPP3 levels in samples from normal healthy subjects. Replacing "that is between 25
and 150 ng/ml for plasma DPP3" by the corresponding expression could potentially
overcome both the objection as to lack of clarity raised in the present communication as
well as the objection as to lack of sufficient disclosure raised in the summons.

The applicant is thus invited to amend claims 1 and 10 accordingly.

It is noted that this suggestion is made only for assisting the applicant in deciding how to
proceed. It in no way precludes consideration of alternative solutions submitted by the
applicant. The responsibility for determining the text of the application (Article 113(2)
EPC) and, in particular, for defining the subject-matter for which protection is sought
remains with the applicant.

Once the claims are re-drafted, they would then be considered to relate to patentable
subject matter and a carefully adapted description should be provided. Oral proceedings
could then be cancelled and the application could proceed to grant.

An adapted description should fulfill the following requirements:
The technical field of the invention (Rule 42(1)(a) EPC; Guidelines F-II.4.2) must
correspond to the amended set of claims.
The summary of the invention must correspond to the amended set of claims (Rule
42(1)(c) EPC; Guidelines F-II, 4.5). Statements such as "The invention is set out in the
appended set of claims" or "The invention is as defined in claim X" may be used instead
of repeating the claims verbatim.
The description and drawings should not comprise embodiments that are inconsistent
with the amended claims. All occurrences of these inconsistencies must be removed

either by deleting the embodiments or by appropriately marking them so that it is clear
that they do not fall within the subject-matter for which protection is sought (Guidelines
F-IV, 4.3).
Features of the independent claims should not be referred to in the description as being
optional using wording such as "preferably", "may" or "optionally". The description must
be amended to remove such inconsistencies.
If the description comprises "claim-like" language, it must be deleted or amended to
avoid claim-like language prior to grant (Guidelines F-IV, 4.4).
