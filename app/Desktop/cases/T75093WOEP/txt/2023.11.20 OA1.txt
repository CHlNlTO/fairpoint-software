          Document D1 discloses that circulating DPP3 is increased in patients with
           refractory cardiogenic shock despite vasopressor treatment, compared to
           patients having non-refractory shock.
           Document D2 discloses a method for assessing circulatory DPP3 in patients
          with severe sepsis and septic shock and shows that DPP3 levels increase with
          the severity and the mortality risk.
          Document D3 discloses the use of vasopressors e.g. arginine vasopressin for
          the treatment of refractory shock.
          Document D4 discloses the assessment of pro-adrenomedullin fragment for
          determining the outcome of the treatment with anti-adrenomedullin antibody or
          antibody-fragment.
           Document D5 discloses the use of angiotensin II in the treatment of septic
           shock.

3 Novelty (Art. 54 EPC):

3.1    Document D1 is not state of the art as the priority date is valid.

3.2 Claims 13 is directed to a vasopressor for use in the treatment of patients
          having a DPP3 level below a threshold. D3 discloses the use of vasopressors
          e.g. arginine vasopressin for the treatment of refractory shock. It appears that
          the group of patients identified by the level of DPP3 below a threshold which is
          not further specified does not differ from the patients having refractory shock as
          disclosed in D3. Claim 13 lacks novelty in view of D3.

4      Inventive step (Art. 56 EPC):

4.1    Document D2 which is the closest prior art for claims 1 and 21 discloses that

       circulatory DPP3 in patients with severe sepsis and septic shock increases with

       the severity and the mortality risk. The claims differ in that refractory shock is

       diagnosed. It is considered that in view of D2 it would be obvious for a skilled

       person to determine the level of DPP3 in order to assess the risk of refractory

       shock the outcome of a treatment. Claims 1 and 21 do not involve an inventive

       step. The dependent claims 2-12 do not appear to contain any additional

       features which, in combination with the features of any claim to which they refer,

       meet the requirements of the EPC with respect to inventive step. The subject-

       matter of said claims appears to be obvious in view of D2.

4.2 Document D3 discloses the use of vasopressors e.g. arginine vasopressin for
          the treatment of refractory shock. Claim 14 differs in that a DPP3 inhibitor is
          used in patients identified by measuring DPP3 levels i.e. having refractory
           shock. The problem to be solved is defined as to provide a treatment for
          refractory shock. The application does not provide any evidence that refractory
          shock is useful for treating patients having refractory shock. The problem is thus
          not solved. In view of D2 showing that DPP3 levels increase with the severity of
           the symptoms in septic shock patients, it would be obvious for a skilled person
          to consider the use of a DPP3 inhibitor to solve the problem. Claim 14 is not
           inventive. The dependent claim 17 is also not inventive.

4.3 The dependent claims 15-16 differ in that the DPP3 inhibitor is combined with
          an angiotensin-receptor-agonist like angiotensin II. The problem to be solved is
          defined as to provide an improved treatment for refractory shock. The

           application does not provide any evidence of an unexpected technical effect
           due to the claimed combinations. The problem is thus redefined as to provide
          an alternative treatment for refractory shock. Vasopressors e.g. angiotensin II,
          are known from D3 and D5 for the treatment of refractory shock. It would thus

          be obvious for a skilled person to combine a DPP3 inhibitor with an angiotensin-
           receptor-agonist like angiotensin II in order to solve the problem. Claims 15-16
           are not inventive.

4.4 Claims 19-20 differ from D2 in that additionally the level of pro-adrenomedullin
           is assessed and/ an anti-ADM antibody is administered. The problem to be
          solved is to provide an alternative method of diagnosis or method of treatment
          of refractory shock. Document D4 discloses the assessment of pro-
          adrenomedullin fragment for determining the outcome of the treatment with an
          anti-adrenomedullin antibody e.g. in septic shock. In view of the disclosure of
          D1 in combination with D4 a skilled person would have considered to assess
          the level of pro-adrenomedullin in addition to DPP3 and would have envisaged
          the treatment with an anti-adrenomedullin antibody. Claims 19-20 do not involve
           an inventive step.

5      Art. 84 EPC:

5.1    The value of the "predetermined threshold" is not defined in the claims. It is thus

       not possible to assess the scope of the claims. The argument that the physician

       will set the threshold by assessing DPP3 in different groups and set a threshold

       depending if the physician was prepared to accept more less false positives

       cannot be followed. The applicant considers that this would be a routine task for

       a physician. This argument cannot be followed. It is considered that the claims

       are more an invitation to perform a research program in order to determine the

       DPP3 levels which are indicative of a refractory shock. This would require a

       clinical study and would represent an undue burden for a skilled person. It is

       considered that claims 1, 13-14 and 21 do not meet the requirements of Art.84

       EPC.

5.2 It is not clear which compounds fall in the scope of the functional definition
          "inhibitor of the activity of DPP3". Claim 14 does not meet the requirements of
          Art. 84 EPC.

5.3 Claim 18 seems to be dependent of claim 13 but refers to treatment with
          Angiotensin receptor agonists or DPP3 inhibitors whereas claim 13 is directed
           to vasopressors. This inconsistency renders the scope of the claim unclear.

5.4 It is not clear which compounds fall in the scope of the terms "precursor of
          Angiotensin receptor agonists in claims 15-16 and 18. Said claims lack clarity
          (Art. 84 EPC).

5.5 The dependent claims 2-12 should read "a method according to claim 1...". The
          dependent second medical use claims 15-20 should read e.g. "inhibitor of the
          activity of DPP3 for use according to claim...".

6      The applicant is invited to file new claims which take account of the above

       comments.

       When filing amended claims the applicant should at the same time bring the
       description into conformity with the amended claims. Care should be taken
       during revision, especially of the introductory portion and of any statements of
       problem or advantage, not to add subject-matter which extends beyond the
       content of the application as originally filed (Article 123(2) EPC).
