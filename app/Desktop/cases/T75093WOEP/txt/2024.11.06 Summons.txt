The present application is based on the identification of a relation between the plasma
concentration of DPP3 in shock patients (septic, cardiogenic) and the development of
refractory shock. The effect of inhibition of DPP3 by means of AK1967; "Procizumab" in
septic shock-induced heart failure was studied. An improvement was observed.
Based on these findings, the claims relate to a method for predicting or diagnosing a
refractory shock in a subject, an inhibitor of the activity of DPP3 for use in therapy of
refractory shock and a method for prognosing an outcome and/or the risk of an adverse
event in a subject that has developed refractory shock, as detailed below.
The present application seems to demonstrate for the first time that DPP3 is higher in
patients with refractory shock than in shock patients without refractory shock and
demonstrates the correlation with organ failure. While this does not seem to have been
suggested in the prior art, the claims, as presently worded, fail to reflect this finding.
1 Independent claims
1. A method for predicting or diagnosing a refractory shock in a subject
that either runs into shock or that has developed shock,
wherein said method is comprising the steps:
- determining the level of DPP3 in a sample of bodily fluid of said subject;
- comparing said level of determined DPP3 to a predetermined threshold,
wherein said subject is predicted to run into refractory shock or is diagnosed as having
refractory shock if said determined level of DPP3 is above said predetermined
threshold.
13.Inhibitor of the activity of DPP3
for use in therapy of refractory shock in a subject that either runs into shock or that has
developed shock,
wherein said subject has a level of DPP3 in a sample of bodily fluid of said subject that
is above a predetermined threshold when determined by a method according to any of
claims 1 - 11,
wherein the inhibitor of the activity of DPP3 is selected from the group
comprising anti-DPP3 antibody or anti-DPP3 antibody fragment or anti-DPP3
non-Ig scaffold.

18.A method for prognosing an outcome and/or the risk of an adverse event in a subject
that has developed refractory shock, wherein said method is comprising the steps:
- determining the level of DPP3 in a sample of bodily fluid of said subject;
- comparing said level of determined DPP3 to a predetermined threshold,
- correlating said level of DPP3 with said risk of an adverse event in said subject,
wherein an elevated level above a certain threshold is predictive for an enhanced risk of
said adverse events or,
- correlating said level of DPP3 with success of a therapy or intervention in said subject,
wherein a level below a certain threshold is predictive for a success of therapy or
intervention.
2 Added subject matter (Art. 123(2) EPC)
2.1 Claims 1-12 remain unchanged. These claims are based on original claims
1-12.
2.2 Former claims 13, 18, 20 have been deleted.
2.3 Claim 13 is based on original claim 14.
2.4 Claim 14 is based on original claim 15, amended to provide a definition of the
"precursor". According to the paragraph bridging pages 31 and 32 (not 30 and
31) of the originally filed application, "The term "prodrug" refers to any precursor
compound which is able to generate or to release the above mentioned peptide
under physiological conditions". Importantly, this paragraph refers to "An
angiotensin II, angiotensin I", or angiotensin IV therapeutic" and not to any
Angiotensin receptor agonist peptide and hence does not refer to a precursor of
any possible angiotensin receptor agonist peptide.
There is also no clear and unambiguous disclosure of a precursor of an
angiotensin-receptor agonist being "pegylated forms of angiotensin-agonist
peptides". Pegylated forms of the peptides or conjugates as disclosed in US
Patent Publication 2011/0081371 are mentioned page 31. this is not what is
claimed.
The feature "Larger peptides comprising Angiotensin-Receptor-Agonist
peptides, which upon selective cleaving form the Angiotensin-Receptor-Agonist
peptide" seems to be based on page 31 last line and page 32 first line.
Basis for "angiotensinogen, angiotensin I, or its homologues that may result in
angiotensin II by the action of certain endogenous or exogenous enzymes" is to
be found on page 32 lines 2-4. This is however not what is claimed.

Page 32 lines 6-9 indicates that "Suitable protecting groups for amino groups
include the benzyloxycarbonyl, tbutyloxycarbonyl (BOC),
fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl (FMOC), formyl, and acetyl or acyl group. Suitable
protecting groups for the carboxylic acid group include esters such as benzyl
esters or t-butyl esters". These are all alternatives. There is no basis for the
term "and" ("and/or").
Finally, page 32 lines 9-14 refers to precursors of angiotensin II, angiotensin III,
angiotensin IV (not any possible angiotensin receptor agonist peptide) "having
amino acid substitutions, deletions, additions, the substitutions and additions
including the standard D and L amino acids and modified amino acids, such as,
for example, amidated and acetylated amino acids, wherein the therapeutic
activity of the base peptide sequence is maintained at a pharmacologically
useful level".
The subject matter of claim 14 is not clearly and unambiguously derivable from
the originally filed application and the requirements of Art. 123(2) EPC are not
found to be met.
2.5 Claim 15 is based on original claim 16 amended to specify "refractory shock",
based on based on page 1, lines 3-7 and page 13, lines 1-11 wherein the
treatment of refractory shock is envisaged.
2.6 Claim 16 is based on original claim 20, amended to specify "refractory shock",
based on page 1, lines 3-7 and page 13, lines 1-11 wherein the treatment of
refractory shock is envisaged.
2.7 Claim 17 is based on original claim 22.
2.8 Claim 18 is based on original claim 25.
2.9 There is added subject matter, the requirements of Art. 123(2) EPC.
3 Clarity, support (Art. 84 EPC), sufficiency of disclosure (Art. 83 EPC)
3.1 The arguments provided by the applicants in the latest submission have been
duly considered. All objections are nevertheless maintained. The reasons are as
follows.
3.2 Regarding the feature "predetermined threshold". the applicant has argued that
it was common practice for a medical practitioner to choose different thresholds
in order to include or exclude patients based on these thresholds and that
different medical practitioners may chose different threshold values for the
EPO Form 2906 01.91TRI

same medical indication based on individual judgment and experience.
According to the applicant, the decision on how the patients are divided into risk
groups is taken by the medical practitioner.
The Examining Division is of the opinion that either a clear threshold value or an
indication as to how such a predetermined threshold value is to be determined
for comparison are necessary.
The data presented in Figure 13 indicate that DPP3 is related to refractory
shock and that high DPP3 concentrations in plasma of cardiogenic shock
patients are related with a higher risk to develop refractory cardiogenic shock
compared to patients that have DPP3 plasma concentrations below a certain
threshold.
As pointed out by the applicant, Examples 9 and 11 indicate that, the absolute
cutoffs are 59.1 ng/ml in the cardiogenic shock patients and 48.4 ng/mL in
septic shock patients respectively.
Yet this is not what is claimed. Not only the predetermined threshold valued is
not defined, but also the skilled person is left with the burden to determine, in
each case and for each different patient what such a predetermined threshold
value would be.
The applicant has further argued that a medical practitioner may choose the
threshold depending on whether more false-positive or false-negative results
are considered tolerable. The medical practitioner would initiate medical
treatment based on the division of the patients into the respective risk group.
The specific value of a threshold value could thus vary for good reasons. While
this might well be the case, the claims, which define the subject matter for which
protection is sought in terms of technical features, must be clear, as such. In the
absence of a predetermined threshold value or of an indication as to how it is to
be determined, the level of DPP3 in a sample of bodily fluid cannot be
compared.
The subject matter of claim 1 cannot be reproduced by the skilled person
without undue burden, contrary to the requirements of Art. 83 EPC.
The objection as to lack of clarity is maintained (Art. 84 EPC).
The objection as to lack of sufficient disclosure is also maintained (Art. 83 EPC).
It is maintained that the claims are more an invitation to perform a research
program in order to determine the DPP3 levels which are indicative of a
refractory shock. This would require a clinical study and would represent an

undue burden for a skilled person. Relying on the individual expertise and
assessment of a clinical practitioner in the assessment of each individual patient
further highlights the lack of reproducibility.
In that sense, claim 1 is found to contravene both Art. 84 EPC and Art. 83 EPC.
The same applies to all claims, as none of the claims define the referred
"predetermined threshold".
The objection applies mutatis mutandis to the subject matter of claim 11.
Regarding the features "inhibitors of the DPP3 activity" or "inhibitor of the
activity of DPP3", the applicant argued that "DPP3 activity" or "activity of DPP3"
referred to the enzymatic activity. This is however not what is claimed. Even if
this was specified in the claims (which is not the case), it is maintained that
"inhibitors of the DPP3 activity" or "inhibitor of the activity of DPP3" are not part
of the common general knowledge and the functionality is not accepted in the
prior art to have a clear technical meaning. The only inhibitor of DPP3 provided
in the present application is an anti-DPP3 antibody, namely AK1967.
There is thus lack of clarity, as the inhibitor is not defined and lack of technical
support, as only one specific such inhibitor has been used in the examples and
shown to have an effect (Art. 84 EPC). In addition, there is also lack of sufficient
disclosure as it has not been rendered plausible that any or all possible
"inhibitors of the DPP3 activity" or "inhibitor of the activity of DPP3" would be
suitable, let alone effective for achieving a therapeutic effect.
In addition, it is maintained that it is not clear what is intended by "the DPP3
activity". In fact, while DPP3 is a metallopeptidase, as acknowledged in the
present application, "the exact biological function of DPP3 in cellular physiology
is not understood". The activity is by no means limited to the enzymatic activity
as metallopeptidase.
The objection also applies to claims 13-17 (which indicate that "the inhibitor of
the activity of DPP3 is selected from the group comprising anti-DPP3 antibody
or anti-DPP3 antibody fragment or anti-DPP3 non-lg scaffold") as the antibody
or antibody fragment is not defined and the activity which is to be inhibited is
also not defined.
It is noted that that claim 1 indicates "determining the level of DPP3 in a samgle
of bodily fluid of said subject". The bodily fluid is not specified. Claim 1 is thus
not supported by the technical contents description as required by Article 84
EPC, as its scope is broader than justified by the description and examples,
which solely refer to level of DPP3 in whole blood, plasma, and serum. Bodily

fluids include for example saliva, tears, urine, among others. The objection
applies to all claims, which are found to contravene Art. 84 EPC for that reason
also.
Claim 6 indicates that "a treatment is to be initiated and/or maintained and/or
withheld and/ or terminated if said determined level of DPP3 is above said
predetermined threshold". Claim 6 is not clear as such as it envisages both
initiating and terminating at the same time, for example ("and/or"). Claim 7,
which is dependent from claim 6 specifies that "said treatment is selected from
the group of vasopressors, Angiotensin-Receptor-Agonists and/or precursors
thereof, inhibitors of the DPP3 activity and anti-adrenomedullin antibodies or
anti-adrenomedullin antibody fragments" and lacks clarity (Art. 84 EPC) when
read in conjunction with claim 6 which for the same therapeutic agent, and the
same level of DPP3 ("above said predetermined threshold") envisages any of
initiating, maintaining, withholding or terminating the treatment or their
combination. The same situation encompasses contradicting embodiments.
The objection applies mutatis mutandis to the subject matter of claim 9 "
wherein a treatment with Angiotensin-Receptor-Agonists and/ or precursors
thereof and/or inhibitors of the DPP3 activity is to be initiated and/or continued
when the level of DPP3 in said sample is above a certain threshold and/or
wherein a treatment with vasopressors is to be withheld and/ or terminated if
said determined level of DPP3 is above said predetermined threshold" and of
claim 10 "wherein a treatment with vasopressors is to be initiated and/or
continued when the level of DPP3 in said sample is below a certain threshold
and/or wherein a treatment with Angiotensin-Receptor-Agonists and/ or
precursors thereof and/or inhibitors of the DPP3 activity is to be withheld and/ or
terminated if the said determined level of DPP3 is below said predetermined
threshold", as contradicting actions are to be taken under equivalent
circumstances.
In view of the above objections, it is not at present possible to perform a
complete assessment as to the novelty and inventive step of the subject
matter claimed in the present application. Novelty and Inventive step will
be assessed once claims are available which meet the requirements of
Art. 123(2) EPC, Art. 84 EPC and Art. 83 EPC.

Document D1 discloses that circulating DPP3 is increased in patients with
refractory cardiogenic shock despite vasopressor treatment, compared to
patients having non-refractory shock.
Document D2 discloses a method for assessing circulatory DPP3 in patients
with severe sepsis and septic shock and shows that DPP3 levels increase with
the severity and the mortality risk.
Document D3 relates to the treatment of refractory shock. The use of
vasopressors for treating shock is well established.
Document D4 discloses the assessment of pro-adrenomedullin fragment for
determining the outcome of the treatment with anti-adrenomedullin antibody or
antibody-fragment.

D6 suggests the use of Ang II in the treatment of refractory shock.
D7 discloses the use of the DPP3 inhibitory antibody AK1967 in the treatment of
septic shock.
D9 is at least relevant pursuant to Art. 54(3) EPC. |t discloses the use of
Angiotensin-Receptor- Agonist in the treatment of hypotension and shock (claim
1), alone or in combination with an inhibitor of DPP3. Refractory shock does not
seem to be mentioned.
Regarding inventive step, the applicant has indicated that it was known in the
prior art that DPP3 is generally increased in septic as well as cardiogenic shock.
According to the applicant, it could not be deduced therefrom that a distinction
could be made between patients having refractory and non-refractory shock.
The applicant noted that this distinction gave rise to different treatment
consequence, namely stopping vasopressors and giving DPP3 inhibitors/
angiotensin II agonists in the event of refractory shock. In the case of non-
refractory shock, additional vasopressors would be given.
In this respect, the Examining Division notes that the claims, as presently
worded do not enable a predicting or diagnosing a refractory shock based on
DPP3 levels.
The Examining Division also notes that the use of angiotensin II in the event of
refractory shock is known (see D6 below, for example).
The use of vasopressors in the case of non-refractory shock is also well
established (see D3).
The contribution by the applicant lies in the determination of certain DPP3 levels
and their correlation with refractory shock prediction. The therapeutic treatments
for refractory or for non-refractory shock are already known.
The additional data submitted by the applicant and showing in an animal model
that refractory septic shock can be successfully treated using the monoclonal
antibody Procizumab, which binds and inhibits circulating DPP3 activity has
been duly considered.
