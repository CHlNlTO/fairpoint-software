Therapy monitoring under treatment with an anti-Adrenomedullin (ADM) binder

Field of the invention
Subject matter of the present invention is a method for monitoring a therapy in a subject, 5 wherein the subject is under treatment with an anti-Adrenomedullin (ADM) binder selected
from the group comprising an antibody, antibody-fragment and/or non-Ig scaffold,
comprising determining the level of a fragment of pre-pro-Adrenomedullin selected from the
group comprising Midregional Proadrenomedullin (MR-proADM), C-terminal Proadrenomedullin (CT-proADM) and/or Proadrenomedullin N-terminal 20 peptide (PAMP) 10 or fragments thereof in a bodily fluid obtained from said subject; and correlating the level of said fragment of pre-pro-Adrenomedullin with the subject's clinical/medical status of health and/or the risk for an adverse outcome and/or the requirement for adapting therapeutic
measures.

15 Description of the invention ADM is a circulating peptide known to regulate vasodilation and vascular integrity. Increased plasma ADM concentrations have been described for several life-threatening conditions, including cardiovascular diseases and septic shock. A method for the detection and quantification of bioactive ADM (bio-ADM) is described by WO2013072509. Therein,
20 monoclonal antibodies against the amidated C-terminus and middle portion of bio-ADM were generated and used for an immunoassay for the quantification of bioactive ADM in plasma.

Moreover, it has been found that the administration of an anti-ADM antibody or anti-ADM antibody fragment or anti-ADM non-Ig scaffold binding to ADM may reduce considerably 25 the risk of mortality in a patient having a severe acute disease or acute condition.

In recent studies, it could be shown that induction of sepsis lead to an increase of plasma bioADM in animal experiments. Surprisingly, upon administration of an anti-Adrenomedullin (ADM) antibody, the apparent plasma ADM concentration rose considerably quicker and to a 30 higher level than in the vehicle animals. Considering the vast molar excess of the anti-ADM antibody over the endogenous bio-ADM it has to be assumed, that the measured plasma ADM concentration after administration of the anti-ADM antibody in fact mainly represents bioADM complexed with the anti-ADM antibody. However, the disproportional increase of

WO 2019/077082

PCT/EP2018/078647
2

plasma bio-ADM observed after administration of anti-ADM antibody in comparison to

vehicle animals was not associated with a worse outcome.

In fact, it has been found that - surprisingly - under treatment with an anti-ADM antibody,

measurement of bio-ADM is not suitable to monitor the subject's risk for adverse outcome. In

5 contrast, measurement of fragments derived from the ADM-precursor peptide, to which said

anti-ADM antibody does not bind, is suitable for monitoring the stimulation or downregulation of the ADM system in such conditions, as it is not immediately influenced by administration of the anti-ADM antibody and over time correlates with the clinical outcome

of a patient who is under treatment with said anti-ADM antibody.

Background

The peptide adrenomedullin (ADM) was described for the first time in 1993 (Kitamura, K., et
al. 1993. "Adrenomedullin: A Novel Hypotensive Peptide Isolated From Human 15 Pheochromocytoma" Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications, Vol. 192 (2),
pp. 553-560 ) as a novel hypotensive peptide comprising 52 amino acids, which had been isolated from a human pheochromocytome; SEQ ID No .: 1. In the same year, cDNA coding for a precursor peptide comprising 185 amino acids and the complete amino acid sequence of this precursor peptide were also described. The precursor peptide, which comprises, inter alia,
20 a signal sequence of 21 amino acids at the N-terminus, is referred to as
"preproadrenomedullin" (pre-proADM). In the present description, all amino acid positions specified usually relate to the pre-proADM which comprises the 185 amino acids and has the
sequence according to SEQ ID No: 2.

25 The mature adrenomedullin peptide is an amidated peptide (ADM-NH2), which comprises 52 amino acids (SEQ ID No: 1) and which comprises the amino acids 95 to 146 of pre-proADM, from which it is formed by proteolytic cleavage. Mature ADM, bio-ADM and ADM-NH2 is used synonymously throughout this application and is a molecule according to SEQ ID No .: 1.

30 To date, substantially only a few fragments of the peptide fragments formed in the cleavage of the pre-proADM have been more exactly investigated, in particular the physiologically active peptides adrenomedullin (ADM) and "PAMP", a peptide comprising 20 amino acids (22-41) which follows the 21 amino acids of the signal peptide in pre-proADM. The discovery and characterization of ADM in 1993 triggered intensive research activity, the results of which

WO 2019/077082

PCT/EP2018/078647
3

have been summarized in various review articles, in the context of the present description,

reference being made in particular to the articles to be found in an issue of "Peptides" devoted to ADM in particular (Editorial, Takahashi, K. 2001. Peptides, Vol. 22: 1691 and Eto, T. 2001. Peptides Vol. 22: 1693-1711 ). A further review is (Hinson, et al. 2000. Endocrine

5 Reviews Vol. 21(2): 138-167).

It has furthermore been found that the concentrations of ADM, which can be measured in the circulation and other biological liquids are, in a number of pathological states, significantly above the concentrations to be found in healthy control persons. Thus, the ADM level in 10 patients with congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction, kidney diseases, hypertensive disorders, diabetes mellitus, in the acute phase of shock and in sepsis and septic shock are significantly increased, although to different extents. The PAMP concentrations are also increased in some of said pathological states, but the plasma levels are lower relative to ADM (Eto T. 2001. Peptides, Vol. 22: 1693-1711).
15
Furthermore, it is known that unusual high concentrations of ADM are to be observed in sepsis or in septic shock (Eto et al. 2001. Peptides 22: 1693-1711; Hirata et al. 1996. Journal
of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism 81(4): 1449-1453; Ehlenz et al.1997. Exp Clin Endocrinol Diabetes 105: 156-162; Tomoda et al. 2001. Peptides 22: 1783-1794: Ueda et al. 20 1999 Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med.160: 132-136: Wang et al. 2001. Peptides 22: 18351840). The findings are related to the typical hemodynamic changes which are known as
typical phenomena of the course of a disease in patients with sepsis and other severe syndromes, such as, for example, SIRS. Adrenomedullin plays pivotal roles during sepsis development (Wang, Shock 1998. 10(5):383-384: Wang et al. 1998. Archives of surgery 25 133(12): 1298-1304) and in numerous acute and chronic diseases (Parlapiano et al. 1999.
European Review for Medical and Pharmacological Sciences 3:53-61; Hinson et al. 2000 Endocrine Reviews 21(2):138-167).

In the scientific investigations to date, it has been found, inter alia, that ADM may be 30 regarded as a polyfunctional regulatory peptide. It is released into the circulation partially in
an inactive form extended by glycine (Kitamura et al. 1998. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 244(2): 551-555). There is also a binding protein (Pio et al. 2001. The Journal of Biological Chemistry 276(15): 12292-12300), which is specific for ADM and probably likewise modulates the effect of ADM.

WO 2019/077082

PCT/EP2018/078647
4

Moreover, it has been found that the above-mentioned further physiologically active peptide PAMP formed from pre-proADM likewise exhibits a hypotensive effect, even if it appears to have an action mechanism differing from that of ADM (Eto et al. 2001. Peptides 22: 16935 1711; Hinson et al. 2000 Endocrine Reviews 21(2):138-167; Kuwasako et al. 1997. FEBS Lett 414(1): 105-110; Kuwasaki et al. 1999. Ann. Clin. Biochem. 36: 622-628; Tsuruda et al. 2001. Life Sci. 69(2): 239-245; Kangawa et al. EP 0 622 458).

Several methods were described to measure circulating levels of ADM: either ADM directly 10 or indirectly by determining a more stable fragment of its cognate precursor peptide. Recently
a method was published, describing an assay to measure circulating mature ADM (Marino et al. 2014. Crit Care 18: R34).

Other methods to quantify fragments derived from the ADM precursor have been described, 15 e.g. the measurement of MR-proADM (Morgenthaler et al. 2005. Clin Chem 51(10):1823-9),
PAMP (Washimine et al. 1994. Biochem Biophys Res Commun 202(2): 1081-7) and CT-proADM (EP 2 111 552). A commercial homogeneous time-resolved fluoroimmunoassay for the measurement of MR-proADM in plasma on a fully automated system is available
(BRAHMS MR-proADM KRYPTOR; BRAHMS GmbH, Hennigsdorf, Germany) (Caruhel 20 et al. 2009. Clin Biochem 42(7-8):725-8). As these peptides are generated in a stoichiometric
ratio from the same precursor, their plasma levels are correlated to a certain extent.
Plasma concentrations of ADM are elevated in patients with heart failure and correlate with disease severity (Hirayama et al. 1999. J Endocrinol 160: 297-303: Yu et al. 2001. Heart 86: 25 155-160). High plasma ADM is an independent negative prognostic indicator in these subjects (Poyner et al. 2002. Pharmacol Rev 54: 233-246).
The role of MR-proADM in heart failure was explored in several studies. In the BACH study (Maisel et al. 2010. J. Am. Coll. Cardiol. 55: 2062-2076), MR-proADM was powerfully 30 prognostic for death at 90 days, adding prognostic value beyond natriuretic peptides. Subsequent data from the PRIDE study (Shah et al. 2012. Eur. Heart J. 33: 2197-2205) solidified a potential prognostic role for MR-proADM; among patients MR-proADM had the best area under the curve (AUC) for mortality at 1 year. Similarly, levels of MR-proADM in patients with chronic heart failure (CHF) were strongly correlated with disease severity and

WO 2019/077082

PCT/EP2018/078647
5

elevated levels of the peptide were strongly associated with an increased risk of death at 12 months of follow-up (van Haehling et al. 2010. European Journal of Heart Failure 12: 484491; Adlbrecht et al. 2009. European Journal of Heart Failure 11: 361-366).

5 MR-proADM was investigated during treatment in patients with acute decompensated heart failure (Boyer et al. 2012. Congest Heart Fail 18 (2): 91-97): patients whose MR-proADM levels tended to increase during acute therapy had findings associated with persistent congestion. In the 12-24 hour time-period after therapy, patients with elevations of MR-proADM had increased peripheral edema. Kaiser et al. measured MR-proADM in
10 patients with univentricular hearts (Kaiser et al. 2014. Europ J Heart Failure 16: 1082-1088). Levels in patients with a failed Fontan circuit (exhibiting ascites and peripheral edema) were significantly higher as compared to patients without Fontan failure. Moreover, Eisenhut speculated whether treatments leading to a reduction of adrenomedullin levels can reduce the
severity and extent of alveolar edema in pneumonia and septicemia (Eisenhut 2006. Crit Care
15 10: 418).

The role of MR-proADM in the diagnosis and prognosis of sepsis was investigated in some studies. MR-proADM was described as biomarker for differentiating between septic patients and non-septic patients with SIRS (Christ-Crain et al. 2005. Crit Care 9: R816-824; Angeletti
20 et al. 2013. Clin Chem Lab Med 51: 1059-1067). Moreover, several studies reported MR-proADM as prognostic biomarker in sepsis, severe sepsis and septic shock (Christ-Crain et al. 2005. Crit Care 9: R816-824; Suberviola et al. 2012. Swiss Med Wkly 142: w13542; Guiginant et al. 2009. Intensive Care Med 35: 1859-1867; DE LA Torre-Prados et al. 2016. Minerva Anestesiol 82: 760-766; Andaluz-Ojeda et al. 2015. J Infect 71:136-139).
25
WO-A1 2004/097423 describes the use of an antibody against adrenomedullin for diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of cardiovascular disorders. Treatment of diseases by blocking the ADM receptor are also described in the art, (e.g. WO-A1 2006/027147, PCT/EP2005/012844) said diseases may be sepsis, septic shock, cardiovascular diseases, infections, dermatological 30 diseases, endocrinological diseases, metabolic diseases, gastroenterological diseases, cancer, inflammation, hematological diseases, respiratory diseases, muscle skeleton diseases, neurological diseases, urological diseases.

It has been found that the administration of an anti-ADM antibody or anti-ADM antibody fragment or anti-ADM non-Ig scaffold binding to ADM may reduce considerably the risk of mortality in a patient having a severe acute disease or acute condition (WO2013/072510.
WO2013072511, WO2013072512. WO2013072513, WO2013072514).

It shall be understood, that the level of a fragment of pre-pro-Adrenomedullin selected from

the group comprising MR-proADM (SEQ ID No. 4), CT-proADM (SEQ ID No. 5) and/or

PAMP (SEQ ID No. 3) also encompasses fragments thereof, whereby at least one amino acid

is missing and said fragments have a length of at least 5 amino acids, more preferred of at

5 least 10 amino acids, most preferred of at least 15 amino acids.

One embodiment of the present application relates to a method of the preceding embodiment, wherein the level of fragments of pre-proAdrenomedullin (of at least 5 amino acids) is determined by using a binder to said fragments (of at least 5 amino acids).
10
Another embodiment of the present application relates to a method of the preceding embodiment, wherein the binder is selected from the group comprising an antibody, an antibody fragment or a non-Ig-Scaffold binding to fragments of pre-proAdrenomedullin or fragments thereof (of at least 5 amino acids).
15
A bodily fluid according to the present application is a blood sample. A blood sample may be selected from the group comprising whole blood, serum and plasma. In one embodiment of the present application, said sample is selected from the group comprising human citrate plasma, heparin plasma and EDTA plasma.
20
An antibody according to the present invention is a protein including one or more polypeptides substantially encoded by immunoglobulin genes that specifically binds an antigen. The recognized immunoglobulin genes include the kappa, lambda, alpha (IgA), gamma (IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4), delta (IgD), epsilon (IgE) and mu (IgM) constant region 25 genes, as well as the myriad immunoglobulin variable region genes. Full-length immunoglobulin light chains are generally about 25 Kd or 214 amino acids in length. Fulllength immunoglobulin heavy chains are generally about 50 Kd or 446 amino acid in length. Light chains are encoded by a variable region gene at the NH2-terminus (about 110 amino acids in length) and a kappa or lambda constant region gene at the COOH -- terminus. Heavy 30 chains are similarly encoded by a variable region gene (about 116 amino acids in length) and one of the other constant region genes.

The basic structural unit of an antibody is generally a tetramer that consists of two identical pairs of immunoglobulin chains, each pair having one light and one heavy chain. In each pair,

WO 2019/077082

PCT/EP2018/078647
15

the light and heavy chain variable regions bind to an antigen, and the constant regions mediate effector functions. Immunoglobulins also exist in a variety of other forms including, for

example, Fv, Fab, and (Fab')2, as well as bifunctional hybrid antibodies and single chains (e.g., Lanzavecchia et al. 1987. Eur. J. Immunol. 17:105: Huston et al.1988. Proc. Natl. 5 Acad. Sci. U.S.A., 85:5879-5883; Bird et al. 1988. Science 242:423-426; Hood et al.1984

Immunology, Benjamin, N.Y., 2nd ed .; Hunkapiller and Hood 1986. Nature 323:15-16). An

immunoglobulin light or heavy chain variable region includes a framework region interrupted by three hypervariable regions, also called complementarity determining regions (CDR's) (see, Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, E. Kabat et al., U.S. Department of 10 Health and Human Services, 1983). As noted above, the CDRs are primarily responsible for

binding to an epitope of an antigen. An immune complex is an antibody, such as a monoclonal antibody, chimeric antibody, humanized antibody or human antibody, or

functional antibody fragment, specifically bound to the antigen.

15 Chimeric antibodies are antibodies whose light and heavy chain genes have been constructed, typically by genetic engineering, from immunoglobulin variable and constant region genes belonging to different species. For example, the variable segments of the genes from a mouse monoclonal antibody can be joined to human constant segments, such as kappa and gamma 1 or gamma 3. In one example, a therapeutic chimeric antibody is thus a hybrid protein
20 composed of the variable or antigen-binding domain from a mouse antibody and the constant or effector domain from a human antibody, although other mammalian species can be used, or the variable region can be produced by molecular techniques. Methods of making chimeric antibodies are well known in the art, e.g., see U.S. Patent No. 5,807,715. A "humanized" immunoglobulin is an immunoglobulin including a human framework region and one or
25 more CDRs from a non-human (such as a mouse, rat, or synthetic) immunoglobulin. The nonhuman immunoglobulin providing the CDRs is termed a "donor" and the human immunoglobulin providing the framework is termed an "acceptor." In one embodiment, all the CDRs are from the donor immunoglobulin in a humanized immunoglobulin. Constant regions need not be present, but if they are, they must be substantially identical to human
30 immunoglobulin constant regions, i.e., at least about 85-90%, such as about 95% or more identical. Hence, all parts of a humanized immunoglobulin, except possibly the CDRs, are substantially identical to corresponding parts of natural human immunoglobulin sequences. A "humanized antibody" is an antibody comprising a humanized light chain and a humanized heavy chain immunoglobulin. A humanized antibody binds to the same antigen as the donor

WO 2019/077082

PCT/EP2018/078647
16

antibody that provides the CDRs. The acceptor framework of a humanized immunoglobulin or antibody may have a limited number of substitutions by amino acids taken from the donor framework. Humanized or other monoclonal antibodies can have additional conservative

amino acid substitutions, which have substantially no effect on antigen binding or other 5 immunoglobulin functions. Exemplary conservative substitutions are those such as gly, ala;

val, ile, leu; asp, glu; asn, gln; ser, thr; lys, arg; and phe, tyr. Humanized immunoglobulins can be constructed by means of genetic engineering (e.g., see U.S. Patent No. 5,585,089). A
human antibody is an antibody wherein the light and heavy chain genes are of human origin. Human antibodies can be generated using methods known in the art. Human antibodies can be 10 produced by immortalizing a human B cell secreting the antibody of interest. Immortalization can be accomplished, for example, by EBV infection or by fusing a human B cell with a
myeloma or hybridoma cell to produce a trioma cell. Human antibodies can also be produced

by phage display methods (see, e.g., Dower et al., PCT Publication No. WO91/17271; McCafferty et al., PCT Publication No. WO92/001047; and Winter, PCT Publication No. 15 WO92/20791), or selected from a human combinatorial monoclonal antibody library (see the

Morphosys website). Human antibodies can also be prepared by using transgenic animals

carrying a human immunoglobulin gene (for example, see Lonberg et al., PCT Publication No. WO93/12227; and Kucherlapati, PCT Publication No. WO91/10741).

20 Thus, the antibody may have the formats known in the art. Examples are human antibodies, monoclonal antibodies, humanized antibodies, chimeric antibodies, CDR-grafted antibodies. In a preferred embodiment antibodies according to the present invention are recombinantly produced antibodies as e.g. IgG, a typical full-length immunoglobulin, or antibody fragments
containing at least the F-variable domain of heavy and/or light chain as e.g. chemically
25 coupled antibodies (fragment antigen binding) including but not limited to Fab-fragments including Fab minibodies, single chain Fab antibody, monovalent Fab antibody with epitope tags, e.g. Fab-V5Sx2; bivalent Fab (mini-antibody) dimerized with the CH3 domain; bivalent Fab or multivalent Fab, e.g. formed via multimerization with the aid of a heterologous domain, e.g. via dimerization of dHLX domains, e.g. Fab-dHLX-FSx2; F(ab')2-fragments,
30 scFv-fragments, multimerized multivalent or/and multispecific scFv-fragments, bivalent and/or bispecific diabodies, BITE® (bispecific T-cell engager), trifunctional antibodies, polyvalent antibodies, e.g. from a different class than G; single-domain antibodies, e.g. nanobodies derived from camelid or fish immunoglobulines and numerous others.

In addition to antibodies, other biopolymer scaffolds are well known in the art to complex a

target molecule and have been used for the generation of highly target specific biopolymers.

Examples are aptamers, spiegelmers, anticalins and conotoxins.

4) Septic shock

At least one sign of end-organ dysfunction as mentioned under 3) is manifested. Septic shock is indicated, if there is refractory hypotension that does not respond to treatment and

intravenous fluid administration alone is insufficient to maintain a patient's blood pressure

10 from becoming hypotensive.

Very recently, the definitions for sepsis and septic shock have been reexamined and updated
by the sepsis definitions task force group (Singer et al. 2016. JAMA 315 (8): 801-810), which is incorporated here by reference. Sepsis is defined as life-threatening organ dysfunction 15 caused by a dysregulated host response to infection when the body's response to an infection injures its own tissues and organs. Organ dysfunction can be identified as an acute change in
total SOFA score  2 points consequent to the infection. The baseline SOFA score can be assumed to be zero in patients not known to have preexisting organ dysfunction. A SOFA
score  2 reflects an overall mortality risk of approximately 10% in a general hospital 20 population with suspected infection. Even patients presenting with modest dysfunction can
deteriorate further, emphasizing the seriousness of this condition and the need for prompt and appropriate intervention, if not already being instituted.

Septic shock is a subset of sepsis in which underlying circulatory and cellular/metabolic
25 abnormalities are profound enough to substantially increase mortality. Patients with septic
shock can be identified with a clinical construct of sepsis with persisting hypotension requiring vasopressors to maintain MAP 65mmHg and having a serum lactate level >2 mmol/L (18mg/dL) despite adequate volume resuscitation.

dyes, based on the physical principles described for chemiluminescent materials in (Kirk-
Othmer, Encyclopedia of chemical technology, 4th ed., executive editor, J. I. Kroschwitz;

editor M. Howe-Grant, John Wiley & Sons, 1993, vol.15, p. 518-562, incorporated herein by

5 reference, including citations on pages 551-562). Preferred chemiluminescent dyes are

acridiniumesters.

As mentioned herein, an "assay" or "diagnostic assay" can be of any type applied in the field of diagnostics. Such an assay may be based on the binding of an analyte to be detected to one 10 or more capture probes with a certain affinity. Concerning the interaction between capture molecules and target molecules or molecules of interest, the affinity constant is preferably greater than 108 M-1.
In the context of the present invention, "binder molecules" are molecules, which may be used 15 to bind target molecules or molecules of interest, i.e. analytes from a sample. Binder
molecules must thus be shaped adequately, both spatially and in terms of surface features, such as surface charge, hydrophobicity, hydrophilicity, presence or absence of lewis donors and/or acceptors, to specifically bind the target molecules or molecules of interest. Hereby, the binding may for instance be mediated by ionic, van-der-Waals, pi-pi, sigma-pi, 20 hydrophobic or hydrogen bond interactions or a combination of two or more of the aforementioned interactions between the capture molecules and the target molecules or molecules of interest. In the context of the present invention, binder molecules may for instance be selected from the group comprising a nucleic acid molecule, a carbohydrate molecule, a PNA molecule, a protein, an antibody, a peptide or a glycoprotein. Preferably, the 25 binder molecules are antibodies, including fragments thereof with sufficient affinity to a target or molecule of interest, and including recombinant antibodies or recombinant antibody fragments, as well as chemically and/or biochemically modified derivatives of said antibodies or fragments derived from the variant chain with a length of at least 12 amino acids thereof. Chemiluminescent label may be acridinium ester label, steroid labels involving isoluminol
30 labels and the like.

Enzyme labels may be lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), creatine kinase (CPK), alkaline phosphatase, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), acid phosphatase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and so on.

Generation of Antibodies and determination of their affinity constants

5 Several human and murine antibodies were produced and their affinity constants were determined (see Table 2).

Peptides / conjugates for Immunization:

10 Peptides for immunization were synthesized, see Table 2, (JPT Technologies, Berlin,
Germany) with an additional N-terminal Cystein (if no Cystein is present within the selected ADM-sequence) residue for conjugation of the peptides to Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA). The peptides were covalently linked to BSA by using Sulfolink-coupling gel (Perbio-science, Bonn, Germany). The coupling procedure was performed according to the manual of Perbio.
15
The murine antibodies were generated according to the following method:

A Balb/c mouse was immunized with 100µg Peptide-BSA-Conjugate at day 0 and 14 (emulsified in 100ul complete Freund's adjuvant) and 50ug at day 21 and 28 (in 100ul 20 incomplete Freund's adjuvant). Three days before the fusion experiment was performed, the animal received 50µg of the conjugate dissolved in 100ul saline, given as one intraperitoneal and one intra-venous injection.

Splenocytes from the immunized mouse and cells of the myeloma cell line SP2/0 were fused 25 with 1ml 50% polyethylene glycol for 30s at 37°. After washing, the cells were seeded in
96-well cell culture plates. Hybrid clones were selected by growing in HAT medium [RPMI 1640 culture medium supplemented with 20% fetal calf serum and HAT-Supplement]. After two weeks the HAT medium is replaced with HT Medium for three passages followed by returning to the normal cell culture medium.
30
The cell culture supernatants were primary screened for antigen specific IgG antibodies three weeks after fusion. The positive tested microcultures were transferred into 24-well plates for propagation. After retesting, the selected cultures were cloned and recloned using the

WO 2019/077082

PCT/EP2018/078647
38

limiting-dilution technique and the isotypes were determined (see also Lane, R.D. 1985. J. Immunol. Meth. 81: 223-228; Ziegler et al. 1996. Horm. Metab. Res. 28: 11-15).

Mouse monoclonal antibody production:
5
Antibodies were produced via standard antibody production methods (Marx et al. 1997. Monoclonal Antibody Production, ATLA 25, 121) and purified via Protein A. The antibody purities were > 95% based on SDS gel electrophoresis analysis.

10 Human Antibodies:

Human Antibodies were produced by means of phage display according to the following
procedure:

15 The human naive antibody gene libraries HAL7/8 were used for the isolation of recombinant single chain F-Variable domains (scFv) against adrenomedullin peptide. The antibody gene
libraries were screened with a panning strategy comprising the use of peptides containing a biotin tag linked via two different spacers to the adrenomedullin peptide sequence. A mix of panning rounds using non-specifically bound antigen and streptavidin bound antigen were 20 used to minimize background of non-specific binders. The eluted phages from the third round of panning have been used for the generation of monoclonal scFv expressing E.coli strains. Supernatant from the cultivation of these clonal strains has been directly used for an antigen
ELISA testing (see also Hust et al. 2011. Journal of Biotechnology: 152. 159-170; Schütte et al. 2009. PLOS One 4, e6625).
25
Positive clones have been selected based on positive ELISA signal for antigen and negative for streptavidin coated micro titer plates. For further characterizations the scFv open reading frame has been cloned into the expression plasmid pOPE107 (Hust et al., J. Biotechn. 2011), captured from the culture supernatant via immobilised metal ion affinity chromatography and 30 purified by a size exclusion chromatography.

Affinity Constants:

PCT/EP2018/078647

To determine the affinity of the antibodies to Adrenomedullin, the kinetics of binding of Adrenomedullin to immobilized antibody was determined by means of label-free surface 5 plasmon resonance using a Biacore 2000 system (GE Healthcare Europe GmbH, Freiburg, Germany). Reversible immobilization of the antibodies was performed using an anti-mouse Fc antibody covalently coupled in high density to a CM5 sensor surface according to the manufacturer's instructions (mouse antibody capture kit; GE Healthcare). (Lorenz et al. 2011.
Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 55(1): 165-173).
10
The monoclonal antibodies were raised against the below depicted ADM regions of human and murine ADM, respectively. The following table represents a selection of obtained antibodies used in further experiments. Selection was based on target region:

Generation of antibody fragments by enzymatic digestion: The generation of Fab and F(ab)2 fragments was done by enzymatic digestion of the murine full length antibody NT-M. Antibody NT-M was digested using a) the pepsin-based F(ab)2 20 Preparation Kit (Pierce 44988) and b) the papain-based Fab Preparation Kit (Pierce 44985). The fragmentation procedures were performed according to the instructions provided by the
supplier. Digestion was carried out in case of F(ab)2-fragmentation for 8h at 37°C. The
Fab-fragmentation digestion was carried out for 16h, respectively.

Procedure for Fab Generation and Purification: The immobilized papain was equilibrated by washing the resin with 0.5 ml of Digestion Buffer and centrifuging the column at 5000 x g for 1 minute. The buffer was discarded afterwards. The desalting column was prepared by removing the storage solution and washing
5 it with digestion buffer, centrifuging it each time afterwards at 1000 x g for 2 minutes. 0.5ml of the prepared IgG sample where added to the spin column tube containing the equilibrated Immobilized Papain. Incubation time of the digestion reaction was done for 16h on a tabletop rocker at 37. The column was centrifuged at 5000 x g for 1 minute to separate digest from the Immobilized Papain. Afterwards the resin was washed with 0.5ml PBS and centrifuged at
10 5000 x g for 1 minute. The wash fraction was added to the digested antibody that the total sample volume was 1.0ml. The NAb Protein A Column was equilibrated with PBS and IgG Elution Buffer at room temperature. The column was centrifuged for 1 minute to remove storage solution (contains 0.02% sodium azide) and equilibrated by adding 2ml of PBS, centrifuge again for 1 minute and the flow-through discarded. The sample was applied to the
15 column and resuspended by inversion. Incubation was done at room temperature with endover-end mixing for 10 minutes. The column was centrifuged for 1 minute, saving the flowthrough with the Fab fragments. (References: Coulter and Harris 1983. J. Immunol. Meth. 59,

Procedure for generation and purification of F(ab') Fragments: The immobilized Pepsin was equilibrated by washing the resin with 0.5 ml of Digestion 25 Buffer and centrifuging the column at 5000 x g for 1 minute. The buffer was discarded afterwards. The desalting column was prepared by removing the storage solution and washing it with digestion buffer, centrifuging it each time afterwards at 1000 x g for 2 minutes. 0.5ml
of the prepared IgG sample where added to the spin column tube containing the equilibrated Immobilized Pepsin. Incubation time of the digestion reaction was done for 16h on a tabletop
30 rocker at 37°C. The column was centrifuged at 5000 x g for 1 minute to separate digest from the Immobilized Papain. Afterwards the resin was washed with 0.5mL PBS and centrifuged at 5000 x g for 1 minute. The wash fraction was added to the digested antibody that the total sample volume was 1.0ml. The NAb Protein A Column was equilibrated with PBS and IgG Elution Buffer at room temperature. The column was centrifuged for 1 minute to remove

storage solution (contains 0.02% sodium azide) and equilibrated by adding 2mL of PBS,

centrifuge again for 1 minute and the flow-through discarded. The sample was applied to the column and resuspended by inversion. Incubation was done at room temperature with end-

over-end mixing for 10 minutes. The column was centrifuged for 1 minute, saving the flow5 through with the Fab fragments. (References: Mariani et al. 1991. Mol. Immunol. 28: 69-77;

NT-H-Antibody Fragment Humanization: The antibody fragment was humanized by the CDR-grafting method (Jones et al. 1986. 15 Nature 321, 522-525).

The following steps where done to achieve the humanized sequence: Total RNA extraction: Total RNA was extracted from NT-H hybridomas using the Qiagen
kit.
20 First-round RT-PCR: QIAGEN® OneStep RT-PCR Kit (Cat No. 210210) was used. RT-PCR was performed with primer sets specific for the heavy and light chains. For each RNA sample, 12 individual heavy chain and 11 light chain RT-PCR reactions were set up using degenerate forward primer mixtures covering the leader sequences of variable regions. Reverse primers
25 are located in the constant regions of heavy and light chains. No restriction sites were engineered into the primers.

Reaction Setup: 5x QIAGEN® OneStep RT-PCR Buffer 5.0 ul, dNTP Mix (containing 10 mM of each dNTP) 0.8 ul, Primer set 0.5 ul, QIAGEN® OneStep RT-PCR Enzyme Mix 30 0.8 ul, Template RNA 2.0 ul, RNase-free water to 20.0 ul, Total volume 20.0 ul PCR condition: Reverse transcription: 50°, 30 min; Initial PCR activation: 95, 15 min Cycling: 20 cycles of 94, 25 sec; 54, 30 sec; 72, 30 sec; Final extension: 72, 10 min Secondround semi-nested PCR: The RT-PCR products from the first-round reactions were further

WO 2019/077082

PCT/EP2018/078647
42

amplified in the second-round PCR. 12 individual heavy chain and 11 light chain RT-PCR

reactions were set up using semi-nested primer sets specific for antibody variable regions.

Reaction Setup: 2x PCR mix 10 ul; Primer set 2 ul; First-round PCR product 8 ul; Total 5 volume 20 ul; Hybridoma Antibody Cloning Report PCR condition: Initial denaturing of
5 min at 95; 25 cycles of 95° for 25 sec, 57 for 30 sec, 68 for 30 sec; Final extension
is 10 min 68°C.

After PCR is finished, run PCR reaction samples onto agarose gel to visualize DNA 10 fragments amplified. After sequencing more than 15 cloned DNA fragments amplified by
nested RT-PCR, several mouse antibody heavy and light chains have been cloned and appear correct. Protein sequence alignment and CDR analysis identifies one heavy chain and one light chain. After alignment with homologous human framework sequences the resulting humanized sequence for the variable heavy chain is the following: see figure 5. As the amino
15 acids on positions 26, 40 and 55 in the variable heavy chain and amino acid on position 40 in
the variable light are critical to the binding properties, they may be reverted to the murine original. The resulting candidates are depicted below. (Padlan 1991. Mol. Immunol. 28, 489498; Harris and Bajorath. 1995. Protein Sci. 4. 306-310).

20 Example 2

The influence of anti-NT-H Adrenomedullin antibody HAM8101 (Adrecizumab) has been explored on clinical and laboratory parameters of septic pigs in a two-hit model. First hit was a hemorrhagic shock, and second hit was sepsis induction by application of an E. coli fibrin 25 clot (peritoneal contamination and infection; PCI). HAM8101 was administered at the time point, when sepsis was induced.

Study Execution
5
Animals We anaesthetised and ventilated 16 female German Landrace pigs (n=16; mean ± standard deviation (SD) 33 ± 1.5 kg body weight (BW)) and followed the standard procedures for laboratory animal care. This study was approved by the institutional and local committee on 10 the care and use of animals (Landesamt für Natur, Umwelt und Verbraucherschutz NordrheinWestfalen, Germany, 84-02.04.2015.A037).

General Anesthesia and Catheterisation Animals were premedicated with azaperone (1-2 mg/kg BW) and ketamine (10 mg/kg BW),
15 and general anesthesia was induced by intravenous injection of propofol (1-2 mg/kg BW).
The animals were orally intubated and placed in the supine position. General anaesthesia was maintained with infusions of propofol and fentanyl. Controlled pressure mode ventilation was chosen to ventilate the animals with an inspiratory oxygen fraction of 0.5, an inspiratory/expiratory ratio of 1:1.5, PEEP set to 5 cm H2O and a tidal volume of 8-10 ml/kg 20 BW. The respiratory rate was set to maintain a PaCO2 of 3.5-4.5 kPa. The body core temperature was maintained above 37.5 with a warming blanket. Two central venous catheter were inserted into the external jugular vein and the femoral vein and an arterial PICCO catheter was inserted into the femoral artery by transcutaneous puncture.

25 At the end of the study the animals were euthanised in the presence of a veterinarian with a lethal dose of Narcoren® (Merial, Hallbergmoos, Germany) while they were still under deep
narcosis.

Escherichia coli Fibrin Clot 30 In this model, we used an E. coli-fibrin clot with 7-9x1011 colony-forming units (CFUs) per
kg/BW to induce septic shock.

Haemodynamic Measurements

WO 2019/077082

PCT/EP2018/078647
46

All intravascular pressure measurements were referenced to the mid-chest level, and values

were obtained at end-expiration. Heart rate, mean arterial pressure (MAP), central venous

pressure (CVP) and stroke volume variation (SVV) were recorded continuously. Cardiac

output was measured using transpulmonary thermodilution (PICCO, Pulsion medical systems, 5 Feldkirchen, Germany). Extravascular lung water (EVLW), intrathoracic blood volume

(ITBV) and global end-diastolic volume (GEDV) were calculated using standard formula.

Laboratory Blood gas analyses were conducted using a standard blood gas oximetry system (ABL 800; 10 Radiometer, Copenhagen, Denmark) with a co-oximeter. Blood count, electrolytes, creatinine, urea and liver enzymes were determined using standard laboratory techniques. We measured neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using a commercially available kit (Pig NGAL ELISA Kit, BioPorto, Hellerup, Denmark). Creatinine clearance was measured as an estimate of the glomerular filtration rate 15 (ClCrea = Ucrea × Uvol/Pcrea × duration of urine collection period; Ucrea = urine creatinine concentration; Uvol = urine volume during the collection period; Pcrea = serum creatinine concentration). We measured the BW of the animals before and after the experiment. Wet/dry ratio of the lung was determined by weighing a part of the left upper lobe immediately after the experiment and after 5 days. Blood coagulation was analysed performing a rotational
20 thromboelastometry (ROTEM delta, TEM international, Basel, Switzerland). Levels of cytokines (IL-6 and TNF-a) in plasma were assessed by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using commercially available kits specific for pigs.

Bioactive adrenomedullin (bio-ADM) was measured using a novel chemiluminescence 25 immunoassay provided by Sphingotec GmbH (Hennigsdorf, Germany), as previously
described (Marino et al. 2014. Crit Care 18:R34). In brief, in a one-step sandwich chemiluminescence immunoassay, based on Acridinium NHS-ester labeling for the detection of bioactive ADM in unprocessed, neat plasma, it uses two mouse monoclonal antibodies, one directed against the midregion (solid phase), and the other directed against the amidated
30 C-terminal moiety of ADM (labelled antibody). The assay utilizes 50 uL of plasma samples/calibrators and 200 µL of labelled detection antibody. The analytical assay sensitivity is 2 pg/mL. The assay is suitable for measuring bio-ADM from numerous mammalian
species, including humans and pigs, and it detects both free bio-ADM and bio-ADM, when HAM 8101 (Adrecizumab) is bound to it (Weber et al. 2017. J Appl Lab Medicine, in press).

Plasma MR-proADM was measured with the B.R. A.H.M.S MR-proADM KRYPTOR assay

according to the manufacturer's instructions (Thermo Fisher, Hennigsdorf, Germany).

Experimental Protocol 5 During catheterisation animals received 10 ml/kg BW/hr of a balanced crystalloid solution.
Haemorrhagic shock was induced by bleeding the animals via the femoral vein catheter. The animals were bled until half of the baseline MAP was reached. Haemorrhagic shock was maintained for 45 minutes, followed by fluid resuscitation with a balanced crystalloid solution in order to restore baseline mean arterial pressure. 2 hours after haemorrhagic shock the blood 10 collected during haemorrhagic shock was re-transfused. As second hit, sepsis was induced using an E. coli-laden clot placed into the abdominal cavity 6 hours after haemorrhagic shock. Animals were randomly allocated to receive either the adrenomedullin antibody or the vehicle solution. The solutions were delivered in neutral bags and the groups were blinded for the investigators and marked with A or B. The therapy with the antibody or vehicle solution 15 started immediately after the induction of sepsis. 2 mg/kg BW of the antibody/ vehicle solution were infused over a period of 30 minutes. 4 hours after sepsis had been induced the therapy of the septic shock started using balanced crystalloids and noradrenalin on demand. Volume replacement and vasopressor were titrated to maintain a central venous pressure of 812 mmHg, a mean arterial pressure above 65mmHg and a central venous oxygen saturation of 20 70%, as recommended by the Surviving Sepsis Campaign. Sepsis therapy continued for another 8 hours. Measurements were performed before haemorrhagic shock, before sepsis induction and 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12 hours after sepsis induction. Haemorrhagic and septic shock were not performed on the animals of the SHAM-groups, but apart from that, they received the same treatment including all intravascular catheter, the median laparotomy and 25 the blinded application of the antibody/ vehicle solution.

Results:
As expected, induction of sepsis lead to an increase of plasma bio-ADM in the vehicle animals. Surprisingly, upon administration of HAM 8101, the apparent plasma bio-ADM
30 concentration rose considerably quicker and to a higher level than in the vehicle animals (Fig. 2A). Considering the vast molar excess of HAM 8101 over the endogenous bio-ADM it has to be assumed that the measured plasma ADM concentration after administration of HAM 8101 in fact mainly represents bio-ADM complexed with the HAM 8101 antibody. In order to investigate, whether the observed HAM8101-induced faster and more pronounced increase of

WO 2019/077082

PCT/EP2018/078647
48

plasma bio-ADM was due to enhanced expression of the ADM gene and/or release of ADM

gene-products, plasma concentrations of another peptide derived from the ADM precursor

peptide were measured, namely MR-proADM (mid-regional pro-Adrenomedullin). As shown in Figure 2B, plasma levels of MR-proADM increased similarily upon sepsis induction

5 independent from whether animals were treated with HAM8101 or vehicle. Thus, it appears that the HAM8101-induced faster and more pronounced increase of plasma ADM is not due

to enhanced expression of the ADM gene and/or release of ADM gene-products.

The overproportional increase of plasma bio-ADM observed after administration of HAM 10 8101 in comparison to vehicle animals was not associated with a worse outcome:
Animals having received HAM 8101 required less volume resuscitation to achieve a target mean arterial pressure than the vehicle animals (Fig. 3).

Only one third of the animals having received HAM 8101 required noradrenaline 15 administration on top of volume resuscitation to achieve a target mean arterial pressure,
whereas all the vehicle animals required noradrenaline (Fig.4).

As shown in Fig. 4, among the HAM 8101-treated animals, one third required noradrenaline, whereas two thirds did not. These two groups differed in their development of plasma 20 MR-proADM concentrations (Fig. 5). Those animals developing shock, e.g. requiring noradrenaline on top of fluid resuscitation, had considerably higher MR-proADM concentrations than the other animals. The latter, successfully treated animals had lower
MR-proADM concentrations than the vehicle group.

25 Taken together, the data demonstrate that - surprisingly - under treatment with HAM 8101, measurement of bio-ADM is not suitable to monitor the subject's risk for adverse outcome. In contrast, measurement of MR-proADM, as an example of another fragment derived from the ADM-precursor peptide to which HAM 8101 does not bind, is suitable for monitoring the stimulation or down-regulation of the ADM system in such condition, as it is not immediately
30 influenced by administration of HAM 8101 and over time correlates with clinical outcome.

The influence of a monoclonal anti-C-terminal Adrenomedullin antibody generated against SEQ ID No .: 20 (HAM2302) on ADM levels in Male Wistar rats (Charles River, Sulzfeld) 5 has been explored.

Sampling of blood (K3-EDTA-Plasma  150 uL or 3-4 mL at terminal bleeding (-80)) was done at time points -3d, 12min, 1h, 3h, 6h, 24h, 48, 4d, 7d, 10d. The animals were treated with a single intravenous injection (5ml/kg bodyweight). 10 Injection and sampling was successful for all animals. Antibody-treated animals showed no obvious signs of toxic effects.

Measurement of ADM and free HAM2302 in plasma
15
In order to measure, Adrenomedullin in plasma samples containing the HAM2302 the tADMAssay was utilized. This assay uses an N-terminal anti-ADM antibody generated against SEQ ID No .: 25 as solid phase (HAM 1112) and a mid-regional anti-ADM antibody generated against amino acid 27 to 39 of ADM (AHQIYQFTDK DKD; SEQ ID No .: 22) (HAM 2903) 20 as tracer. Calibrators made of synthetic rat bio-ADM (1-50)-NH2 (YRQSMNQGSRSTGCRFGTCTMQKLAHQIYQFTDKDKDGMAPRNKISPQGY-NH2, Seq ID No .: 23) are used to quantify the ADM in the sample. In contrast to the bio-ADM assay mentioned above, the tADM-assay does not specifically measure the amidated form of ADM, but can detect all forms of ADM.
25
Purified monoclonal HAM 2903 antibody (1 g/L) was labeled by incubation in 10% labeling buffer (500 mmol/L sodium phosphate, pH 8.0) with 1: 5 mol/L ratio of MACN-acridiniumNHS-ester (1 g/L, InVent GmbH) for 30 min at 22  in the dark. After adding 5% 1 mol/L Tris-HC1, pH 8.0, for 10 min, the HAM 2903 antibody was separated from free label via 30 CentriPure P5 columns (emp Biotech GmbH) and by size-exclusion HPLC on Protein KW-803 (Shodex, Showa Denko Europe).

White polystyrene microtiter plates (Greiner Bio-One International AG) were coated (18 h at 22 °) with monoclonal HAM 1112 antibody (1.5 µg/0.2 mL per well 50 mmol/L Tris-HCl, 100 mmol/L NaCl, pH 7.8). After wash and blocking with 30 g/L Karion, 5 g/L bovine serum 5 albumin (protease free), 6.5 mmol/L monopotassium phosphate, 3.5 mmol/L sodium dihydrogen phosphate (pH 6.5) for 1.5 hours, the plates were vacuum-dried.

Synthetic rat ADM (rADM) (peptides & elephants) was serially diluted using 20 mmol/L potassium hydrogenphosphate, 0.5 g/L bovine serum albumin (BSA), 6 mmol/L sodium 10 EDTA, 50 umol/L amastatin, 100 umol/L leupeptin; pH 8.
Fifty uL of samples/calibrators were pipetted into coated microtiter plates. After addition of 150 µL of labeled C-terminal antibody HAM 2302, microtiter plates were incubated for 20 h at 2-8  under agitation. Unbound tracer was removed by washing five times (each 350 uL 15 per well) with washing solution (400 mmol/L Tris, 1 g/L Tween 20, 3 mol/L NaCL, pH 7.5). Wellbound chemiluminescence was measured for 1 s per well by using the Centro LB 960 microtiter plate luminescence reader (Berthold Technologies).

For determination of free HAM2302, the Adrenomab-1 Assay was used. A mid-regional anti20 ADM antibody generated against amino acid 21-32 (SEQ ID No .: 24) functions as solid
phase. The MACN-labelled C-terminal Ab (HAM 2302)) functions as tracer. Quantification of the HAM 2302 in a sample utilizes a competitive assay design. Calibrators made of non-
labeled HAM 2302 together with a constant hADM concentration (10 ng/mL) are utilized to generate the standard curve to determine the concentration in unknown samples. With 25 increasing concentrations of the calibrator/antibody in the sample, the measured light signal declines because less tracer can bind to adrenomedullin.

Purified monoclonal HAM 2302 (1 g/L) was labeled by incubation in 10% labeling buffer (500 mmol/L sodium phosphate, pH 8.0) with 1:4.5 mol/L ratio of MACN-acridinium-NHS30 ester (1 g/L, InVent GmbH) for 30 min at 22  in the dark. After adding 5% 1 mol/L TrisHCI, pH 8.0, for 10 min, HAM 2302 was separated from free label via CentriPure P10 columns (emp Biotech GmbH) and by size-exclusion HPLC on Protein KW-803 (Shodex, Showa Denko Europe).

White polystyrene microtiter plates (Greiner Bio-One International AG) were coated (18 h at 20 ) with monoclonal midregional antibody against amino acid 21-32 of ADM

(1 µg/0.2 mL per well 50 mmol/L Tris-HCI, 100 mmol/L NaCl, pH 7.8). After blocking with 30 g/L Karion, 5 g/L BSA (protease free), 6.5 mmol/L monopotassium phosphate, 5 3.5 mmol/L sodium dihydrogen phosphate (pH 6.5) for 1.5 hours, the plates were vacuum-
dried.

A serial dilution of HAM 2302 prepared with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), 2.5 g/L bovine serum albumin pH 7.4 was used.
10
Fifty uL of samples/calibrators and 100 uL of a 10 ng/ml hADM in phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS), 2.5 g/L bovine serum albumin pH 7.4 were pipetted into coated microtiter plates. After one-hour incubation at 2-8  under agitation, 100 uL of labeled HAM 2302, were pipetted into coated microtiter plates. After incubation of the plates for another 2.5 hours 15 at 2-8  under agitation., unbound tracer was removed by washing five times (each 350 uL per well) with washing solution (20 mmol/L PBS, 1 g/L Triton X-100, pH 7.4). Wellbound chemiluminescence was measured for 1 s per well by using the Centro LB 960 microtiter plate luminescence reader (Berthold Technologies).

20 Results:
In samples of HAM2302 treated animals plasma concentrations free HAM2302 measured at 3h post-injection were 481,9 ug/mL (± 46,8 µg/mL). Mean ADM concentration in vehicle animals was 14,6 ± 3,75 pg/ml. The concentration of Adrenomedullin in HAM2302-treated animals was about 100-fold higher (1411 ± 67 pg/mL) compared to vehicle animals (Fig. 6).

acid 1-52), comprising

· determining the level of a fragment of pre-pro-Adrenomedullin selected from the

group comprising Midregional Proadrenomedullin (MR-proADM), C-terminal

10

Proadrenomedullin (CT-proADM) and/or Proadrenomedullin N-terminal 20

peptide (PAMP) or fragments thereof in a bodily fluid obtained from said subject; and

· correlating said level of the fragment of pre-pro-Adrenomedullin selected from the

group comprising MR-proADM, CT-proADM and/or PAMP with the subject's

15

clinical/medical status of health and/or the risk for an adverse outcome and/or the

requirement for adapting therapeutic measures, and

· wherein for the determination of the level of said fragments at least one binder binds to a region within the amino acid sequence selected from the group comprising SEQ ID NO. 3, SEQ ID NO. 4 and SEQ ID NO. 5, respectively.
20
2. A method according to claim 1, wherein the binder for the treatment is an anti-ADM antibody or an anti-adrenomedullin antibody fragment or an anti-ADM non-Ig protein scaffold, wherein said antibody or fragment or scaffold binds to the N-terminal part, aa 1-21, of adrenomedullin:

4. A method according to claim 1 to 3, wherein the binder for the treatment is an anti-

ADM antibody or an anti-adrenomedullin antibody fragment or an anti-ADM non-Ig

protein scaffold, wherein said antibody or fragment or scaffold binds to the mid-

5

regional part, aa 21-42, of adrenomedullin:

CTVQKLAHQIYQFTDKDKDNVA; SEQ ID No. 21.

5. A method according to any of the preceding claims, wherein the determination of the

10

level of said fragments is performed at least once.

6. A method according to any of the preceding claims, wherein the adverse outcome is selected from the group comprising worsening clinical condition such as worsening
organ function, and mortality.

7. A method according to any of the preceding claims, wherein said subject suffers from

15

a disease or condition, e.g. a chronic or acute disease or acute condition.

8. A method according to any of the preceding claims, wherein the disease the subject is

suffering from may be selected from the group comprising severe infections as e.g.

meningitis, Systemic inflammatory Response-Syndrome (SIRS,) sepsis; other diseases

20

as diabetes, cancer, acute and chronic vascular diseases as e.g. heart failure,

myocardial infarction, stroke, atherosclerosis; shock as e.g. septic shock and organ

dysfunction as e.g. kidney dysfunction, liver dysfunction, burnings, surgery, traumata.

25

are selected from the group comprising fluid resuscitation, vasopressors/inotropes,

renal replacement therapy, antibiotics, hydrocortisone, insulin, enteral

nutrition/parenteral nutrition.

10. A method according to any of the preceding claims, wherein the level of said fragment

30

of pre-pro-Adrenomedullin selected from the group comprising MR-proADM,

CT-proADM and/or PAMP of at least 5 amino acids is determined by an

immunoassay using at least one binder selected from the group comprising a binder to

WO 2019/077082

PCT/EP2018/078647
59

MR-proADM or a fragment thereof and/or to CT-proADM or a fragment thereof and/or to PAMP or a fragment thereof, respectively.

11. A method according to any of the preceding claims, wherein for the correlation an

elevated level of said fragment of pre-pro-Adrenomedullin selected from the group

5

comprising MR-próADM, CT-proADM and/or PAMP or fragments thereof above a

certain threshold is predictive for an enhanced risk for an adverse outcome, and/or a

level of said fragment of pre-pro-Adrenomedullin or fragments thereof below a certain

threshold is predictive for a reduced risk for an adverse outcome.

12. A method according to any of the preceding claims, wherein for the correlation of the

10

level of the fragment of pre-pro-Adrenomedullin the determination of the level of said

fragment is performed at least twice and wherein a decrease of the second measured

level of said fragment in comparison to the measured first level of said fragment, is

predictive for a reduced risk for an adverse outcome.

13. A method according to any of the preceding claims, wherein for the correlation of the

15

level of the fragment of pre-pro-Adrenomedullin the determination of the level of said

fragments is performed at least twice and wherein an increase of the second measured

level of said fragment in comparison to the measured first level of said fragment, is

predictive for an enhanced risk for an adverse outcome.

14. A method according to any of the preceding claims, wherein said bodily fluid may be

20

selected from the group comprising blood, serum, plasma, urine, cerebrospinal fluid

(CSF), and saliva.

15. A method according to any of the preceding claims in order to stratify said subjects
into risk groups.
