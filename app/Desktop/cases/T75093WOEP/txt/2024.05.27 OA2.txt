1        Independent claims

1. A method for predicting or diagnosing a refractory shock in a subject

           that either runs into shock or that has developed shock,

wherein said method is comprising the steps:
   - determining the level of DPP3 in a sample of bodily fluid of said subject;
   - comparing said level of determined DPP3 to a predetermined threshold,

wherein said subject is predicted to run into refractory shock or is diagnosed as having
refractory shock if said determined level of DPP3 is above said predetermined
threshold.

13.Vasopressor for use in therapy of shock in a subject that either runs into shock or
that has
developed shock,
wherein said subject has a level of DPP3 in a sample of bodily fluid of said subject that
is below a predetermined threshold,
when determined by a method according to any of claims 1 - 11.

14.|nhibitor of the activity of DPP3

for use in therapy of refractory shock in a subject that either runs into shock or that has
developed shock,

wherein said subject has a level of DPP3 in a sample of bodily fluid of said subject that
is above a predetermined threshold when determined by a method according to any of
claims 1 - 11,

          wherein the inhibitor of the activity of DPP3 is selected from the group
           comprising anti-DPP3 antibody or anti-DPP3 antibody fragment or anti-DPP3
           non-Ig scaffold.

21 .A method for prognosing an outcome and/or the risk of an adverse event in a subject
that has developed refractory shock, wherein said method is comprising the steps:
- determining the level of DPP3 in a sample of bodily fluid of said subject;
- comparing said level of determined DPP3 to a predetermined threshold,
- correlating said level of DPP3 with said risk of an adverse event in said subject,
wherein an elevated level above a certain threshold is predictive for an enhanced risk of
said adverse events or,
- correlating said level of DPP3 with success of a therapy or intervention in said subject,
wherein a level below a certain threshold is predictive for a success of therapy or
intervention.

2      Clarity, support (Art. 84 EPC), sufficiency of disclosure (Art. 83 EPC)

2.1    It is maintained that claim 1 is not clear, contrary to the requirements of Art. 84

       EPC.

       Claim 1 refers to a "predetermined threshold" which is not defined. The claims
       must be clear as such and must define all technical features necessary for
       achieving the claimed technical effect. This is not the case here, contrary to the
       requirements of Art. 84 EPC. In fact, the method of claim 1 relies on a
       comparison of a level of DPP3 in a sample with a predetermined threshold
       which is not defined in the claims. The subject matter of claim 1 cannot be
       reproduced by the skilled person without undue burden, contrary to the
       requirements of Art. 83 EPC.

          It is maintained that the claims are more an invitation to perform a research
          program in order to determine the DPP3 levels which are indicative of a
          refractory shock. This would require a clinical study and would represent an
          undue burden for a skilled person.

             In that sense, claim 1 is found to contravene both Art. 84 EPC and Art. 83 EPC.

          The same applies to all claims, as none of the claims define the referred
           "predetermined threshold".

2.2 The terms "inhibitors of the DPP3 activity" or "inhibitor of the activity of DPP3"
           employed throughout the claims are not clear, contrary to the requirements of
          Art. 84 EPC.

          It is noted that "inhibitors of the DPP3 activity" or "inhibitor of the activity of
           DPP3" are not part of the common general knowledge and the functionality is
           not accepted in the prior art to have a clear technical meaning. In fact, it is not
          clear what is intended by "the DPP3 activity". In fact, while DPP3 is a
           metallopeptidase, as acknowledged in the present application, "the exact
           biological function of DPP3 in cellular physiology is not understood". In addition,
           the only inhibitor of DPP3 provided in the present application is an anti-DPP3
           antibody, namely AK1967.

           The subject matter of claims 7, 9, 10, 12, 14-19 is found to contravene both Art.
          84 EPC and Art. 83 EPC.

2.3 As indicated in the former communication, claim 18 seems to be dependent of
           claim 13 but refers to treatment with Angiotensin receptor agonists or DPP3
           inhibitors whereas claim 13 is directed to vasopressors. This inconsistency
           renders the scope of the claim unclear, contrary to the requirements of Art. 84
          EPC.

2.4 It is not clear which compounds fall within the scope of the terms "precursor of
          Angiotensin receptor agonists in claims 15-16 and 18. Said claims lack clarity
          (Art. 84 EPC).

           In view of the above objections, it is not at present possible to perform a
          complete assessment as to the novelty and inventive step of the subject
          matter claimed in the present application. The applicant is hereby given
           one more opportunity to provide amended claims which overcome the
           above objections before oral proceedings are summoned, as requested.

3.4     The priorities claimed appear to be valid. D1, published on 31.08.2019, is not
3.4.1   part of the prior art for the present assessment.

3.4.2   The cited documents disclose the following:

3.4.3   Document D1 discloses that circulating DPP3 is increased in patients with
3.4.4   refractory cardiogenic shock despite vasopressor treatment, compared to
        patients having non-refractory shock.
3.4.5
        Document D2 discloses a method for assessing circulatory DPP3 in patients
        with severe sepsis and septic shock and shows that DPP3 levels increase with
        the severity and the mortality risk.

        Document D3 relates to the treatment of refractory shock. The use of
        vasopressors for treating shock is well established.

        Document D4 discloses the assessment of pro-adrenomedullin fragment for
        determining the outcome of the treatment with anti-adrenomedullin antibody or
        antibody-fragment.

        Document D5 discloses the use of angiotensin II in the treatment of septic
        shock.

3.5 In the letter dated 18.03.24, the applicant has indicated that the patient group of
          D3 was not identical to the patient group as claimed in the present application.
          The applicant argued that claim 13 was directed to a vasopressor for treating a
           patient with shock who had a DPP3 value below a threshold value.

           The Examining Division notes that since the "threshold value" is not defined in
          the claims, it cannot serve to delimit or define a group of patients.

          According to the applicant, these patients do not have a refractory (=
          vasopressor-resistant) shock according to claim 1 (have or develop it).

          Again, it is noted that no group of patients is defined in the claims. In that sense,
           D3, which discloses the use of vasopressors e.g. arginine vasopressin for the
           treatment of refractory shock, anticipates the subject matter of at least claim 13.

          According tot he applicant, in D3 there is an overview of therapeutic strategies
           in patients with high-dose vasopressor-dependent/refractory shock. No
          statements are made here about DPP3 levels. With the help of the
           determination of DPP3, the medical practitioner can better control the
           administration of vasopressors, i.e. the medical practitioner would not give
           vasopressors to patients who would only respond to this therapy to a limited
          extent or no longer at all (which can be determined by high DPP3 levels).

          Again, the Examining Division cannot agree with this assessment. There is no
          group of patients defined in claim 13.
           The objection is maintained.
3.6 Regarding inventive step, the applicant has indicated that it was known in the
          prior art that DPP3 is generally increased in septic as well as cardiogenic shock.
          According to the applicant, it could not deduced therefrom that a distinction
          could be made between patients having refractory and non-refractory shock.
          The applicant noted that this distinction gave rise to different treatment
           consequence, namely stopping vasopressors and giving DPP3 inhibitors/
          angiotensin II agonists in the event of refractory shock. In the case of non-
           refractory shock, additional vasopressors would be given.
           In this respect, the Examining Division notes that the claims, as presently
           worded do not enable a predicting or diagnosing a refractory shock based on
          DPP3 levels.
          The Examining Division also notes that the use of angiotensin II in the event of
          refractory shock is known (see D6 below, for example).
          The use of vasopressors in the case of non-refractory shock is also well
          established (see D3).
          In that sense, the group of patients treated is not different from that of the prior
           art. The contribution by the applicant lies in the determination of certain DPP3
           levels and their correlation with refractory shock prediction. The therapeutic
          treatments for refractory or for non-refractory shock are already known.

3.7 The additional data submitted by the applicant and showing in an animal model
           that refractory septic shock can be successfully treated using the monoclonal
          antibody Procizumab, which binds and inhibits circulating DPP3 activity has
           been duly considered.

3.8 It is however maintained that in view of D2 it would be obvious for a skilled
          person to determine the level of DPP3 in order to assess the risk of refractory
           shock the outcome of a treatment.

3.9 The following documents are cited by the Examiner for the sake of
           completeness. A copy of the documents is annexed to the communication and
          the numbering will be adhered to in the rest of the procedure.
