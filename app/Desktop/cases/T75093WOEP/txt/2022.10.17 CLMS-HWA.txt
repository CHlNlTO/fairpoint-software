            CLAIMS §marked-up!

1. A method for predicting or diagnosing a refractory shock in a subject that either runs into shock or
   that has developed shock, wherein said method is comprising the steps:
   0 determining the level of DPP3 in a sample of bodily fluid of said subject;
   0 compaiing said level of determined DPP3 to a predetermined threshold,
   wherein said subject is predicted to run into refractory shock or is diagnosed as having refractory
        shock if said determined level of DPP3 is above said predetermined threshold.

2. A method for predicting or diagnosing a refractory shock in a subject that either runs into shock or
    that has developed shock according to claim 1, wherein said shock is selected from the group
    compiising shock due to hypovolemia, cardiogenic shock, obstructive shock and distributive shock,
    in particular cardiogenic shock or septic shock.

3. A method for predicting or diagnosing a refractory shock in a subject that either runs into shock or
    that has developed shock according to claim 1 or 2, wherein said shock is a vasopressor-resistant
    shock.

4. A method for predicting or diagnosing a refractory shock in a subject that either runs into shock or
    that has developed shock according to claims 1 to 3, wherein
    0 in case of cardiogenic shock said subject may have suffered an acute coronary syndrome (e.g.
        acute myocardial infarction) or wherein said subject has heart failure (e.g. acute decompensated
        heart failure), myocarditis, arrhythmia, cardiomyopathy, valvular heart disease, aOItic dissection
        with acute aOItic stenosis, traumatic chordal rupture or massive pulmonary embolism, or
    0 in case of hypovolemic shock said subject may have suffered a hemorrhagic disease including
        gastrointestinal bleed, trauma, vascular etiologies (e.g. ruptured abdominal aOItic aneurysm,
        tumor eroding into a major blood vessel) and spontaneous bleeding in the setting of
        anticoagulant use or a non-hemorrhagic disease including vomiting, diarrhea, renal loss, skin
        losses/insensible losses (e.g. bums, heat stroke) or third-space loss in the setting of pancreatitis,
        cirrhosis, intestinal obstruction, trauma, or
    0 in case of obstructive shock said patient may have suffered a cardiac tamponade, tension
        pneumothorax, pulmonary embolism or aOItic stenosis, or
    0 in case of distributive shock said patient may have septic shock, neurogenic shock, anaphylactic
         shock or shock due to adrenal crisis.
5. A method for predicting or diagnosing a refractory shock in a subject that either runs into shock or
    that has developed shock according to claims 1 to 4, wherein said method is used for initiation
    and/or termination and/ or stratification and/or guidance of treatment.

6. A method for predicting or diagnosing a refractory shock in a subject that either runs into shock or

    and/or maintained and/or withheld and/ or terminated if said determined level of DPP3 is above
    said predetermined threshold.

7. A method for predicting or diagnosing a refractory shock in a subject that either runs into shock or
    that has developed shock according to claim 6, wherein said treatment is selected from the group of
    vasopressors, Angiotensin-Receptor-Agonists and/or precursors thereof, inhibitors of the DPP3
    activity and anti-adrenomedullin antibodies or anti-adrenomedullin antibody fragments.

8. A method for predicting or diagnosing a refractory shock in a subject that either runs into shock or
    that has developed shock according to any of claims 1 to 7, wherein either the level of DPP3
    protein and/or the level of active DPP3 is determined and compared to a predetermined threshold,
    wherein the level of DPP3 is determined by contacting said sample of bodily fluid with a capture
    binder that binds specifically to DPP3.

9. A method for predicting or diagnosing a refractory shock in a subject that either runs into shock or
    that has developed shock according to any of claims 1 to 8, wherein a treatment with Angiotensin-

    initiated and/or continued when the level of DPP3 in said sample is above a ceItain threshold
    and/or wherein a treatment with vasopressors is tggmjmmwithheld and/ or terminated if said
    determined level of DPP3 is above said predetermined threshold.

10. A method for predicting or diagnosing a refractory shock in a subject that either runs into shock or
    that has developed shock according to any of claims 1 to 9, wherein a treatment with vasopressors
    is m_wbmgminitiated and/or continued when the level of DPP3 in said sample is below a ceItain
    threshold and/or wherein a treatment with Angiotensin-Receptor-Agonists and/ or precursors
    thereof and/or inhibitors of the DPP3 activity is tggmbgg__withhe1d and/ or terminated if the said
    determined level of DPP3 is below said predetermined threshold.
11A method for predicting or diagnosing a refractory shock in a subject that either runs into shock or
   that has developed shock according to claim 9, wherein in addition the level of Pro-adrenomedullin
   or fragments thereof is determined and wherein treatment with an anti-ADM antibody or anti-ADM
   antibody fragment is jiggmmminitiated and/or continued when the level of Pro-adrenomedullin or
   fragments thereof in said sample is above a ceItain threshold and/or wherein a treatment with an

   determined level of Pro-adrenomedullin or fragments thereof is below said predetermined
   threshold.

12A method for predicting or diagnosing a refractory shock in a subject that either runs into shock or
   that has developed shock according to claim 9, wherein treatment with an anti-ADM antibody or
   anti-ADM antibody fragment and/or Angiotensin-Receptor-Agonists and/ or precursors thereof
   and/or inhibitors of the DPP3 activity is mmmminitiated and/or continued if the level of Pro-
   adrenomedullin or fragments thereof in said sample is above a ceItain threshold and said
   determined level of DPP3 is above said predetermined threshold of DPP3.

13.Vasopressor for use in therapy of shock in a subject that either runs into shock or that has
   developed shock, wherein said subject has a level of DPP3 in a sample of bodily fluid of said
    subject that is below a predetermined threshold, when determined by a method according to any of
    claims 1-- 11.

   bodily fluid of said subject that is above a predetermined threshold when determined by a method
   according to any of claims 1 -- 11, wherein the inhibitor of the activity of DPP3 is selected from the
   group comprising anti-DPP3 antibody or anti-DPP3 antibody fragment or anti-DPP3 non-Ig
    scaffold.
