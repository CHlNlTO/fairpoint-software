      STATE OF THE ART
      Dipeptidyl peptidase 3 - also known as Dipeptidyl aminopeptidase III, Dipeptidyl arylamidase

10 III, Dipeptidyl peptidase III, Enkephalinase B or red cell angiotensinase; short name: DPP3,
      DPPIII - is a metallopeptidase that removes dipeptides from physiologically active peptides,

      such as enkephalins and angiotensins.
      DPP3 was first identified and its activity measured in extracts of purified bovine anterior
      pituitary by Ellis & Nuenke 1967. The enzyme, which is listed as EC 3.4.14.4, has a molecular
15 mass of about 83 kDa and is highly conserved in procaryotes and eucaryotes (Prajapati &
      Chauhan 2011). The amino acid sequence of the human variant is depicted in SEQ ID NO 1.
      Dipeptidyl peptidase III is a mainly cytosolic peptidase which is ubiquitously expressed.
      Despite lacking a signal sequence, a few studies reported membranous activity (Lee & Snyder
      1982).

20 DPP3 is a zinc-depending exo-peptidase belonging to the peptidase family M49. It has a broad

substrate specificity for oligopeptides from three/ four to ten amino acids of various

compositions and is also, capable of cleaving after proline. DPP3 is known to hydrolyze

     dipeptides from the N-terminus of its substrates, including angiotensin II, III and IV; Leu- and
     Met-enkephalin; endomorphin 1 and 2. The metallopeptidase DPP3 has its activity optimum at
25 pH 8.0-9.0 and can be activated by addition of divalent metal ions, such as Co2+ and Mg2+.

Structural analysis of DPP3 revealed the catalytic motifs HELLGH (hDPP3 450-455) and

EECRAE (hDPP3 507-512), as well as following amino acids, that are important for substrate

binding and hydrolysis: Glu316, Tyr, 318, Asp366, Asn391, Asn394, His568, Arg572, Arg577,

Lys666 and Arg669 (Prajapati & Chauhan 2011; Kumar et al. 2016; numbering refers to the

30 sequence of human DPP3, see SEQ ID NO. 1). Considering all known amino acids or sequence
      regions that are involved in substrate binding and hydrolysis, the active site of human DPP3

can be defined as the area between amino acids 316 and 669.

                                                                          8.5.25

                                                                          ...

                          2

       The most prominent substrate of DPP3 is angiotensin II (Ang II), the main effector of the renin-
       angiotensin system (RAS). The RAS is activated in cardiovascular diseases (Dostal et al. 1997.
       J Mol Cell Cardiol:29:2893-902; Roks et al. 1997. Heart Vessels. Suppl 12:119-24), sepsis,
       and septic shock (Corrêa et al. 2015. Crit Care 2015:19:98). Ang II, in particular, has been
  5 shown to modulate many cardiovascular functions including the control of blood pressure and
       cardiac remodeling.

       The exact biological function of DPP3 in cellular physiology is not understood, but recent
       findings indicate its role not only in in protein metabolism but also in pain modulation and
       inflammatory processes (Prajapati & Chauhan 2011). In addition, DPP3 reduced blood
 10 pressure in AngII-infused hypertensive mice, without changing heart rate (Pang et al. 2016).
       However normotensive mice had no alteration in blood pressure, when DPP3 was injected.

       Blood pressure reduction by administration of DPP3 together with an angiotensin-receptor
       antagonist in Ang II-infused mice was similar to that of DPP3 injection alone or angiotensin-
       receptor antagonist alone (Pang et al. 2016. Hypertension 68:630-41).

. 15 Angiotensin II (AngII) is a peptide hormone naturally produced by the body that regulates blood
       pressure via vasoconstriction and sodium reabsorption. The hemodynamic effects of Ang II
       administration have been the subject of numerous clinical studies, demonstrating significant
       effects on systemic and renal blood flow (Harrison-Bernard 2009. Adv. Physiol Edu. 33(4):
       270).

20 AngII-treatment is currently discussed for its beneficial effect in vasodilatory shock and septic

        shock (Khanna, A. et al., 2017; Antonucci, E. et al. 2017, Tumlin, J.A. et al. 2018). Patients
       with vasodilatory shock (80% in septic shock) treated with angiotensin II were more likely to
       survive to 28 days and showed a significant correction of hypotension (Khanna, A. et al., 2017;
        Tumlin, J.A. et al. 2018).

 25 It is assumed that the Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) is highly dysregulated in shock
       patients leading to an altered angiotensin I/II ratio) and that angiotensin II infusion may
       compensate for such dysregulation (Tumlin, J.A. et al. 2018).

       Recently, two assays were generated, characterized, and validated to specifically detect DPP3
       in human bodily fluids (e.g., blood, plasma, serum): a luminescence immunoassay (LIA) to.
 30 detect DPP3 protein concentration and an enzyme capture activity assay (ECA) to detect
       specific DPP3 activity (Rehfeld et al. 2019 JALM 3(6):943-953). A washing step in both
       methods removes all interfering substances before the actual detection of DPP3 protein or
    EP 20 764 639.9  DESCRIPTION (08.05.2025)                                   3-4

    DPP3 in blood samples.

 5 Shock is characterized by decreased oxygen delivery and/or increased oxygen consumption or
      inadequate oxygen utilization leading to cellular and tissue hypoxia. It is a life-threatening
      condition of circulatory failure and most commonly manifested as hypotension (systolic blood
      pressure less than 90 mm Hg or MAP less than 65 mmHg). Shock is divided into four main
      types based on the underlying cause: hypovolemic, cardiogenic, obstructive, and distributive

10 shock (Vincent and De Backer 2014. N. Engl. J. Med. 370(6): 583).

      Hypovolemic shock is characterized by decreased intravascular volume and can be divided into
      two broad subtypes: hemorrhagic and nonhemorrhagic. Common causes of hemorrhagic
      hypovolemic shock include gastrointestinal bleed, trauma, vascular etiologies (e.g. ruptured
      abdominal aortic aneurysm, tumor eroding into a major blood vessel) and spontaneous bleeding
15 in the setting of anticoagulant use. Common causes of nonhemorrhagic hypovolemic shock
      include vomiting, diarrhea, renal loss, skin losses/insensible losses (e.g. burns, heat stroke) or
      third-space loss in the setting of pancreatitis, cirrhosis, intestinal obstruction, trauma. For
      review see Koya and Paul 2018. Shock. StatPearls [Internet]. Treasure Island (FL): StatPearls
       Publishing: 2019-2018 Oct 27.

20 Cardiogenic shock (CS) is defined as a state of critical endorgan hypoperfusion due to reduced
      cardiac output. Notably, CS forms a spectrum that ranges from mild hypoperfusion to profound
      shock. Established criteria for the diagnosis of CS are: (i) systolic blood pressure, 90 mmHg
      for >30 min or vasopressors required to achieve a blood pressure 90 mmHg; (ii) pulmonary
      congestion or elevated left-ventricular filling pressures; (iii) signs of impaired organ perfusion

25 with at least one of the following criteria: (a) altered mental status; (b) cold, clammy skin; (c)
      oliguria (< 0.5 mL/kg/h or <30 mL/h); (d) increased serum-lactate (Reynolds and Hochman
      2008. Circulation 117: 686 697). Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) with subsequent
      ventricular dysfunction is the most frequent cause of CS accounting for approximately 80% of
      cases. Mechanical complications such as ventricular septal (4%) or free wall rupture (2%), and

30. acute severe mitral regurgitation (7%) are less frequent causes of CS after AMI. (Hochman et
      al. 2000. J Am Coll Cardiol 36: 1063-1070). Non-AMI-related CS may be caused by
      decompensated valvular heart disease, acute myocarditis, arrhythmias, etc. with heterogeneous
      treatment options. This translates in 40 000 to 50 000 patients per year in the USA and 60 000
      to 70 000 in Europe. Despite advances in treatment mainly by early revascularization with

                                                  4K
   EP 20 764 639.9  DESCRIPTION (08.05.2025)                                              8-9
                              8

   subsequent mortality reduction, CS remains the leading cause of death in AMI with mortality
   rates still approaching 40-50% according to recent registries and randomized trials (Goldberg
   et al. 2009. Circulation 119: 1211-1219).

        Obstructive shock is due to a physical obstruction of the great vessels or the heart itself. Several
   5 conditions can result in this form of shock (e.g. cardiac tamponade, tension pneumothorax,

        pulmonary embolism, aortic stenosis). For review see Koya and Paul 2018. Shock. StatPearls
        [Internet]. Treasure Island (FL): StatPearls Publishing: 2019-2018 Oct 27.

   According to the cause, there are four types of distributive shock: neurogenic shock (decreased

   sympathetic stimulation leading to decreased vasal tone), anaphylactic shock, septic shock and

   10 shock due to adrenal crisis. In addition to sepsis, distributive shock can be caused by systemic

   inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) due to conditions other than infection such as

   pancreatitis, burns or trauma. Other causes include, toxic shock syndrome (TSS), anaphylaxis

   (a sudden, severe allergic reaction), adrenal insufficiency (acute worsening of chronic adrenal

   insufficiency, destruction or removal of the adrenal glands, suppression of adrenal gland

   15 function due to exogenous steroids, hypopituitarism and metabolic failure of hormone

   production), reactions to drugs or toxins, heavy metal poisoning, hepatic (liver) insufficiency

.  and damage to the central nervous system. For review see Koya and Paul 2018. Shock.

   StatPearls [Internet]. Treasure Island (FL): StatPearls Publishing; 2019-2018 Oct 27.

         In general, refractory shock has been defined as requirement of noradrenaline infusion of >0.5

   20 ug/kg/min despite adequate volume resuscitation. Mortality in these patients may be as high as
         94% and the assessment and management of these patients requires a much more aggressive
         approach for survival. The term ,,refractory shock" is used when the tissue perfusion cannot be
         restored with the initial corrective measures employed (e.g. vasopressors) and may therefore be
         referred to as ,,high vasopressor-dependent" or ,,vasopressor-resistant" shock (Udupa and

   25 Shetty 2018. Indian J Respir Care 7: 67-72). Patients with refractory shock may have features
         of inadequate perfusion such as hypotension (mean arterial blood pressure <65 mmHg),
         tachycardia, cold peripheries, prolonged capillary refill time, and tachypnea consequent to the
        hypoxia and acidosis. Fever may be seen in septic shock. Other signs of hypoperfusion such as
         altered sensorium, hyperlactatemia, and oliguria may also be seen. These well-known signs of

   30 shock are not helpful in identifying whether the problem is at the pump (heart) or circuitry
         (vessels and tissues). Different types of shock can coexist, and all forms of shock can become
         refractory, as evidenced by unresponsiveness to high-dose vasopressors (Udupa and Shetty
         2018. Indian J Respir Care 7: 67-72).

      In a specific embodiment of the invention said refractory shock is vasopressor-resistant, that is
      defined by unresponsiveness of the patient to high dose vasopressors (e.g. >0.5 µg/kg/min

      noradrenaline).

      The consequence of the diagnosis or the prediction that a subject either runs into a vasopressor-
      resistant refractory shock or is diagnosed with a vasopressor-resistant refractory shock maybe
      the administration of treatment like administration of angiotensin II inhibitors and/or DPP3
      inhibitors. Furthermore, another consequence maybe the withholding of vasopressors.

      A further embodiment of the present invention relates to a method for predicting or diagnosing
      a refractory shock in a subject that either runs into shock or that has developed shock according
      to the present invention, wherein a treatment is initiated and/or maintained and/or withheld and/
      or terminated if said determined level of DPP3 is above said predetermined threshold.

      Another embodiment of the present invention relates to a method for predicting or diagnosing
      a refractory shock in a subject that either runs into shock or that has developed shock, wherein
      treatment with an anti-ADM antibody or anti-ADM antibody fragment and/or Angiotensin-
      Receptor-Agonists and/or precursors thereof and/or inhibitors of the DPP3 activity is initiated
10 and/or continued if the level of Pro-adrenomedullin or fragments thereof in said sample is above
      a certain threshold and said determined level of DPP3 is above said predetermined threshold of

       DPP3.

      In a specific embodiment of the invention the threshold is within a threshold range for plasma
15 DPP3 that is between 20 and 200 ng/ml, preferably between 25 and 150 ng/ml, even more

      preferred between 30 and 100 ng/ml, even more preferred between 35 and 75 ng/ml, most
     preferred a threshold of 50 ng/ml is applied.

      In particular the refractory shock of said patient is a vasopressor-resistant shock.

20 The peptide adrenomedullin (ADM) was described as a novel hypotensive peptide comprising

       52 amino acids, which had been isolated from a human pheochromocytoma (Kitamura et al.
      1993. Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications 192 (2): 553-560). Cleavage of
       the N-terminal signal sequence of 21 amino acids from pre-pro-Adrenomedullin (pre-proADM)

      results in the precursor peptide pro-Adrenomedullin (proADM) (SEQ ID No .: 31). Pro-ADM

25 is further cleaved into PAMP (SEQ ID No. 32), MR-proADM (SEQ ID No. 33), ADM-Gly

      (SEQ ID No .: 35) and CT-proADM (SEQ ID No. 36). The mature adrenomedullin peptide is
      an amidated peptide (ADM-NH2), which comprises 52 amino acids (SEQ ID No: 34) and which
      comprises the amino acids 95 to 146 of pre-proADM, from which it is formed by proteolytic
      cleavage. Mature ADM, bio-ADM and ADM-NH2 is used synonymously throughout this
30 application and is a molecule according to SEQ ID No .: 34.

In one embodiment of the subject matter of the present invention said fragment of
pro-Adrenomedullin is selected from a group comprising PAMP (SEQ ID No. 32),

                                           4K
EP 20 764 639.9  DESCRIPTION (08.05.2025)  12 -13
                          12

MR-proADM (SEQ ID No. 33), amidated ADM (SEQ ID No. 34), ADM-Gly (SEQ ID No .:
35) and CT-proADM (SEQ ID No. 36).

     ADM may be regarded as a polyfunctional regulatory peptide. It is released into the circulation
5 partially in an inactive form extended by glycine (Kitamura et al. 1998. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

     Commun. 244(2): 551-555). There is also a binding protein (Pio et al. 2001. The Journal of
     Biological Chemistry 276(15): 12292-12300), which is specific for ADM and probably.

     likewise modulates the effect of ADM.

10 Those physiological effects of ADM as well as of PAMP, which are of primary importance in
      the investigations to date, were the effects influencing blood pressure. Thus, ADM is an
      effective vasodilator. It was found that the concentrations of ADM, which can be measured in

      the circulation and other biological fluids, are in a number of pathological states, significantly
      above the concentrations to be found in healthy control persons. Thus, the ADM level in
15 patients with congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction, kidney diseases, hypertensive
     disorders, diabetes mellitus, in the acute phase of shock and in sepsis and septic shock are
      significantly increased, although to different extents. The PAMP concentrations are also
      increased in some of said pathological states, but the plasma levels are reduced relative to ADM
      (Eto et al. 2001. Peptides 22: 1693-1711).

20

      Furthermore, it is known that unusual high concentrations of ADM are to be observed in sepsis
      or in septic shock (Eto et al. 2001. Peptides 22: 1693-1711; Hirata et al. 1996. Journal of
       Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism 81(4): 1449-1453; Ehlenz et al.1997. Exp Clin

       Endocrinol Diabetes 105: 156-162; Tomoda et al. 2001. Peptides 22: 1783-1794; Ueda et al.

25 1999 Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 160: 132-136; Wang et al. 2001. Peptides 22: 1835-1840).

      The findings are related to the typical hemodynamic changes which are known as typical
      phenomena of the course of a disease in patients with sepsis and other severe syndromes, such
      as, for example, SIRS. Adrenomedullin plays pivotal roles during sepsis development (Wang,

       Shock 1998, 10(5):383-384; Wang et al. 1998. Archives of surgery 133(12): 1298-1304) and in 3
30 numerous acute and chronic diseases (Parlapiano et al. 1999. European Review for Medical

       and Pharmacological Sciences 3:53-61; Hinson et al. 2000 Endocrine Reviews 21(2):138-167).
      MR-proADM has been identified as a prognostic marker that is able to stratify the mortality

      risk in sepsis patients with different degrees of organ failure. It may be helpful in the early
      identification and individual risk assessment of sepsis and may also facilitate the subsequent

                                     18

clinical management of sepsis and septic shock (for review see Onal et al. 2018. Healthcare 6:
110).

     Several methods were described to measure circulating levels of ADM: either ADM directly or
5 indirectly by determining a more stable fragment of its cognate precursor peptide. Recently a

     method was published, describing an assay to measure circulating mature ADM (Weber et al.
     2017. JALM 2: 222-233).

      Other methods to quantify fragments derived from the ADM precursor have been described,
10 e.g. the measurement of MR-proADM (Morgenthaler et al. 2005. Clin Chem 51(10): 1823-9),

      PAMP (Washimine et al. 1994. Biochem Biophys Res Commun 202(2):1081-7) and CT-
      proADM (EP 2 111 552). A commercial homogeneous time-resolved fluoroimmunoassay for

      the measurement of MR-proADM in plasma on a fully automated system is available
      (BRAHMS MR-proADM KRYPTOR; BRAHMS GmbH, Hennigsdorf, Germany) (Caruhel et

15 al. 2009. Clin Biochem 42(7-8):725-8). As these peptides are generated in a stoichiometric ratio
      from the same precursor, their plasma levels are correlated to a certain extent.

     The generation of anti-ADM antibodies is known in the art (e.g. WO2013072512 and
      WO2019057992 incorporated herein by reference).

20

      Also described herein is an anti-ADM antibody or an anti-ADM antibody fragment for use in
      treatment of shock in a subject that either runs into shock or that has developed shock, wherein
      said antibody or fragment or scaffold binds to the N-terminal part (aa 1-21) of mature ADM:
      YRQSMNNFQGLRSFGCRFGTC (SEQ ID No. 37).

25

      In another preferred embodiment said anti-ADM antibody or an anti-ADM antibody fragment
      recognizes and binds to the N-terminal end (aa1) of ADM. N-terminal end means that the amino
      acid 1, that is "Y" of SEQ ID No. 34 and 35 is mandatory for antibody binding. Said antibody
      or fragment or non-Ig scaffold would neither bind N-terminal extended nor N-terminally
30 modified ADM nor N-terminally degraded ADM.

      Endothelial dysfunction can result from and/or contribute to several disease processes, as occurs
      in shock, especially septic shock. From preclinical experiments in models of sepsis/ septic
      shock it is known that administration of the anti-ADM antibody induces an increase of the
30 plasma bio-ADM concentration and that this coincides with an increased survival rate (Struck
      et al. 2013. Intensive Care Med Exp 1(1):22). The mechanism underlying this effect has been
      described in Geven et al. 2018 (Geven et al. 2018. SHOCK 50 (2): 132-140). Briefly, the

                                                 4
EP 20 764 639.9  DESCRIPTION (08.05.2025)  15 -16

      antibody, when administered i.v., due to its size cannot cross the endothelial barrier into the
     interstitium, but remains in the blood circulation. In contrast, ADM, as a small peptide, can
      freely diffuse across the endothelial barrier. Thus, the antibody, when administered in a vast

     molar excess over the endogenous ADM, binds virtually all ADM in the plasma and, as a simple
5 consequence of reaching binding equilibrium, leads to a translocation of ADM from the

      interstitium to the blood circulation. Interstitially located ADM can bind to vascular smooth
      muscle cells and induces relaxation resulting in vasodilation. This is reduced by administration
     of the antibody. On the other hand, ADM in plasma binds to endothelial cells and thereby.
      stabilizes or even restores vascular integrity. Thus, this function is strengthened, when plasma
10 ADM levels increase as a consequence of administration of the antibody, which is a non-
     neutralizing antibody. Finally, binding of the antibody to ADM reduces the proteolytic decay
      of ADM. Taken together, the anti-ADM antibody Adrecizumab may restore endothelial
      function in shock e.g. in septic shock,

15 If said level of Pro-Adrenomedullin or fragments thereof is above a certain threshold level the
      anti-ADM antibody or anti-ADM antibody fragment binding to ADM is administered as
      therapy:

      Also described herein is said anti-ADM antibody or anti-ADM antibody fragment binding to
20 ADM for therapy, wherein a sample of bodily fluid taken from said patients exhibits an elevated

      level of proADM and/or fragments thereof having at least 5 amino acids above a certain
      threshold. Thus, the diagnostic method using said proADM and/or fragments serves as
      companion diagnostic method.

25 In a specific embodiment of the invention the threshold is within a threshold range for plasma
     ADM-NH2 that is between 50 and 250 pg/ml, preferably between 55 and 200 pg/ml, even more
      preferred between 60 and 150 pg/ml, even more preferred beween 65 and 100 pg/ml, most

        more preferred between 95 and 250 pmol/L, even more preferred between 100 and 200 pmol/L,

         The ADM-NH2 levels of the present invention or proADM levels or fragments thereof,
         respectively, have been determined with the described ADM-NH2 assay, as outlined in the
         examples (or proADM or fragments thereof assays, respectively) (Weber et al. 2017. JALM
         2(2):1-4). The DPP3 levels of the present invention have been determined with the described
   10 DPP3-assays as outlined in the examples. The mentioned threshold values above might be
         different in other assays, if these have been calibrated differently from the assay systems used
         in the present invention. Therefore, the mentioned cut-off values above shall apply for such
         differently calibrated assays accordingly, taking into account the differences in calibration. One
        possibility of quantifying the difference in calibration is a method comparison analysis
   15 (correlation) of the assay in question with the respective biomarker assay used in the present

        invention by measuring the respective biomarker (e.g. bio-ADM, DPP3) in samples using both

         methods. Another possibility is to determine with the assay in question, given this test has
         sufficient analytical sensitivity, the median biomarker level of a representative normal
         population, compare results with the median biomarker levels as described in the literature and
   20 recalculate the calibration based on the difference obtained by this comparison. With the
         calibration used in the present invention, samples from normal (healthy) subjects have been
         measured: median plasma bio-ADM (mature ADM-NH2) was 24.7 pg/ml, the lowest value 11
         pg/ml and the 99th percentile 43 pg/ml (Marino et al. 2014. Critical Care 18:R34). With the
         calibration used in the present invention, samples from 5,400 normal (healthy) subjects
   25 (swedish single-center prospective population-based Study (MPP-RES)) have been measured:
        median (interquartile range) plasma DPP3 was 14.5 ng/ml (11:3 ng/ml - 19 ng/ml).

         The plasma median MR-proADM concentration in normal (healthy) subjects was 0.41
         (interquartile range 0.23 - 0.64) nmol/L (Smith et al. 2009. Clin Chem 55:1593-1595) using the
   30 automated sandwich fluorescence assay for the detection of MR-proADM as described in
         Caruhel et al. (Caruhel et al. 2009. Clin Biochem 42:725-8).

      An agonist means a chemical that binds to a receptor and activates the receptor to produce a
     biological response. Receptors can be activated by either endogenous agonists (such as
     hormones and neurotransmitters) or exogenous agonists (such as drugs), resulting in a
15 biological response. Full agonists bind to and activate a receptor with the maximum response
      that an agonist can elicit at the receptor. Partial agonists are drugs that bind to and activate a
      given receptor, but have only partial efficacy at the receptor relative to a full agonist. Potency
     is the amount of agonist needed to elicit a desired response. The potency of an agonist is
      inversely related to its EC50 value. The EC50 can be measured for a given agonist by determining
20 the concentration of agonist needed to elicit half of the maximum biological response of the
      agonist. The EC50 value is useful for comparing the potency of drugs with similar efficacies
      producing physiologically similar effects. The smaller the ECso value, the greater the potency
      of the agonist, the lower the concentration of drug that is required to elicit the maximum
      biological response.

 5 Angiotensin Therapeutics:
     Angiotensin I, also called proangiotensin, is formed by the action of renin on angiotensinogen.
      Renin cleaves the peptide bond between the leucine (Leu) and valine (Val) residues on

     angiotensinogen, creating the decapeptide (ten amino acid) (des-Asp) angiotensin I.
      Angiotensin I is converted to angiotensin II through removal of two C-terminal residues by the.
10 enzyme angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), primarily through ACE within the lung (but
      also present in endothelial cells, kidney epithelial cells, and the brain).

      Angiotensin II, angiotensin III, and angiotensin IV are peptide hormones naturally produced by
      the body that regulates blood pressure via vasoconstriction and sodium reabsorption.
15 Hemodynamic effects of angiotensin II administration have been the subject of numerous
      clinical studies, demonstrating significant effects on systemic and renal blood flow (Harrison-

      Bernard, L.M., The renal renin-angiotensin system. Adv Physiol Educ, 33(4): 270 (2009)).

      Angiotensin II is a hormone produced by the renin angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS) that
20 modulates blood pressure via regulation of vascular smooth muscle tone and extracellular fluid

      homeostasis. Angiotensin II mediates its effects on the vasculature by inducing vasoconstriction
      and sodium retention, and so is the target of many therapies for hypertension. In addition to its
      systemic effects, angiotensin II has a pronounced effect on the efferent arterioles of the kidney,
      maintaining glomerular filtration when blood flow is decreased. Angiotensin II also regulates
25 sodium reabsorption in the kidney by stimulating Na+/H+ exchangers in the proximal tubule
      and inducing the release of aldosterone and vasopressin (Harrison-Bernard 2009. The renal

       renin-angiotensin system. Adv Physiol Educ. 33(4):270).

      The angiotensin II therapeutic that may be used in the compositions and methods of this
30 disclosure may be Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe (SEQ ID NO: 13), also called

      5-isoleucine angiotensin II. SEQ ID NO: 13 is an octa-peptide naturally present in humans and

     The sequence of angiotensin IV used in the compositions and methods disclosed herein may be
     homologous to the sequences of angiotensin IV described above. In certain aspects, the

      invention includes isolated, synthetic, or recombinant amino acid sequences that are at least
 5 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 97%, 98%, 99% or 100% identical to SEQ ID NO: 25, 26, 27, 28, 29

      and/or 30. Any such variant sequences may be used in place of an angiotensin IV as described
      in the preceding paragraph.

      An angiotensin II, angiotensin III, or angiotensin IV therapeutic may be used as any suitable
10 salt (e.g. acetate), deprotected form, acetylated form, deacetylated form, and/or prodrug form

     of the above-mentioned peptides, including pegylated forms of the peptides or conjugates as
     disclosed in US Patent Publication 2011/0081371 (incorporated by reference). The term
      "prodrug" refers to any precursor compound which is able to generate or to release the above-
     mentioned peptide under physiological conditions. Such prodrugs or precursors may be larger
15 peptides which are selectively cleaved in order to form the peptide of the invention. For
      example, in some aspects, the prodrug or precursor may be angiotensinogen, angiotensin I, or
      its homologues that may result in angiotensin II by the action of certain endogenous or
      exogenous enzymes. Further prodrugs or precursors include peptides with protected amino

      acids, e.g., having protecting groups at one or more carboxylic acid and/or amino groups.
20 Suitable protecting groups for amino groups include the benzyloxycarbonyl, t-

      butyloxycarbonyl (BOC), fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl (FMOC), formyl, and acetyl or acyl
      group. Suitable protecting groups for the carboxylic acid group include esters such as benzyl
      esters or t-butyl esters. The present invention also contemplates the use of angiotensin II,

     angiotensin III, angiotensin IV and/or precursor peptides having amino acid substitutions,
25 deletions, additions, the substitutions and additions including the standard D and L amino acids

      and modified amino acids, such as, for example, amidated and acetylated amino acids, wherein
      the therapeutic activity of the base peptide sequence is maintained at a pharmacologically useful
      level.

30 In a preferred embodiment the angiotensin II is angiotensin II acetate. Angiotensin II acetate is

      L-Asparty1-L-arginyl-L-valyl-Ltyrosyl-L-isoleucyl-L-histidyl-L-prolyl-L-phenylalanine,
      acetate salt. The counter ion acetate is present in a non-stoichiometric ratio. The molecular

      formula of angiotensin II acetate is C50H71N13012 . (C2H4O2)n; (n=number of acetate molecules;
     theoretical n = 3) with an average molecular weight of 1046.2 (as free base).

                         32

      In some aspects, it may be beneficial to include a solubilizing agent in the compositions of the
      invention. Solubilizing agents may be useful for increasing the solubility of any of the
      components of the formulation or composition, including a therapeutically effective substance
 5 (e.g., angiotensin II, angiotensin III, or angiotensin IV) or an excipient. The solubilizing agents
      described herein are not intended to constitute an exhaustive list, but are provided merely as
      exemplary solubilizing agents that may be used in the compositions of the invention. In certain

      aspects, solubilizing agents include, but are not limited to, ethyl alcohol, tert-butyl alcohol,
      polyethylene glycol, glycerol, methylparaben, propylparaben, polyethylene glycol, polyvinyl
10 pyrrolidone, and any pharmaceutically acceptable salts and/or combinations thereof.

      In some aspects, it may be beneficial to adjust the pH of the compositions by including a
      pH-adjusting agent in the compositions of the invention. Modifying the pH of a formulation or
      composition may have beneficial effects on, for example, the stability or solubility of a
15 therapeutically effective substance, or may be useful in making a formulation or composition
      suitable for parenteral administration. pH-adjusting agents are well known in the art.
      Accordingly, the pH-adjusting agents described herein are not intended to constitute an

      exhaustive list, but are provided merely as exemplary pH-adjusting agents that may be used in
      the compositions of the invention. pH-adjusting agents may include, for example, acids and
20. bases. In some aspects, a pH-adjusting agent includes, but is not limited to, acetic acid,
      hydrochloric acid, phosphoric acid, sodium hydroxide, sodium carbonate, and combinations

        thereof.

      The pH of the compositions as disclosed herein may be any pH that provides desirable
25 properties for the formulation or composition. Desirable properties may include, for example,

      therapeutically effective substance (e.g., angiotensin II, angiotensin III, or angiotensin IV)
      stability, increased therapeutically effective substance retention as compared to compositions
      at other pHs, and improved filtration efficiency. In some aspects, the pH of the compositions of
      the invention may be from about 3.0 to about 9.0, e.g., from about 5.0 to about 7.0. In particular
30 aspects, the pH of the compositions of the invention may be 5.5±0.1, 5.6±0.1, 5.7±0.1, 5.8±0.1,

      Buffers are well known in the art. Accordingly, the buffers described herein are not intended to
 5 constitute an exhaustive list, but are provided merely as exemplary buffers that may be used in

      the compositions of the invention. In certain aspects, a buffer may include one or more of the
      following: Tris, Tris HC1, potassium phosphate, sodium phosphate, sodium citrate, sodium
      ascorbate, combinations of sodium and potassium phosphate, Tris/Tris HC1, sodium
      bicarbonate, arginine phosphate, arginine hydrochloride, histidine hydrochloride, cacodylate,
10 succinate, 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid (MES), maleate, bis-tris, phosphate,

      carbonate, and any pharmaceutically acceptable salts and/or combinations thereof.

      In some aspects, it may be beneficial to include a surfactant in the compositions of the invention.
      Surfactants, in general, decrease the surface tension of a liquid composition. This may provide
15. beneficial properties such as improved ease of filtration. Surfactants also may act as emulsifying
      agents and/or solubilizing agents. Surfactants are well known in the art. Accordingly, the
      surfactants described herein are not intended to constitute an exhaustive list, but are provided
      merely as exemplary surfactants that may be used in the compositions of the invention.
      Surfactants that may be included include, but are not limited to, sorbitan esters such as
20 polysorbates (e.g., polysorbate 20 and polysorbate 80), lipopolysaccharides, polyethylene
      glycols (e.g., PEG 400 and PEG 3000), poloxamers (i.e., pluronics), ethylene oxides and
      polyethylene oxides (e.g., Triton X-100), saponins, phospholipids (e.g., lecithin), and
      combinations thereof.

25 In some aspects, it may be beneficial to include a tonicity-adjusting agent in the compositions

      of the invention: The tonicity of a liquid composition is an important consideration when
      administering the composition to a patient, for example, by parenteral administration. Tonicity-
      adjusting agents, thus, may be used to help make a formulation or composition suitable for

      administration. Tonicity-adjusting agents are well known in the art. Accordingly, the tonicity-
30 adjusting agents described herein are not intended to constitute an exhaustive list, but are

      provided merely as exemplary tonicity-adjusting agents that may be used in the compositions
      of the invention. Tonicity-adjusting agents may be ionic or non-ionic and include, but are not

      limited to, inorganic salts, amino acids, carbohydrates, sugars, sugar alcohols, and
      carbohydrates. Exemplary inorganic salts may include sodium chloride, potassium chloride,

                                      4K
EP 20 764 639.9  DESCRIPTION (08.05.2025)  34 -35
                         34

sodium sulfate, and potassium sulfate. An exemplary amino acid is glycine. Exemplary sugars
may include sugar alcohols such as glycerol, propylene glycol, glucose, sucrose, lactose, and
mannitol.

 5 In some aspects, it may be beneficial to include a stabilizing agent in the compositions of the
     invention. Stabilizing agents help increase the stability of a therapeutically effective substance
      in compositions of the invention. This may occur by, for example, reducing degradation or
      preventing aggregation of a therapeutically effective substance. Without wishing to be bound
      by theory, mechanisms for enhancing stability may include sequestration of the therapeutically

10 effective substance from a solvent or inhibiting free radical oxidation of the anthracycline
      compound. Stabilizing agents are well known in the art. Accordingly, the stabilizing agents
      described herein are not intended to constitute an exhaustive list, but are provided merely as
      exemplary stabilizing agents that may be used in the compositions of the invention. Stabilizing
      agents may include, but are not limited to, emulsifiers and surfactants.

15

      The compositions as disclosed herein can be administered in a variety of conventional ways. In
      some aspects, the compositions of the invention are suitable for parenteral administration.
      These compositions may be administered, for example, intraperitoneally, intravenously,
      intrarenally, intrathecally or by inhalation. In some aspects, the compositions of the invention
20 are injected intravenously. One of skill in the art would appreciate that a method of
      administering a therapeutically effective substance formulation or composition.of the invention
      would depend on factors such as the age, weight, and physical condition of the patient being
      treated, and the disease or condition being treated. The skilled worker would, thus, be able to
      select a method of administration optimal for a patient on a case-by-case basis.

25

      Angiotensin-receptor-agonist and/ or a precursor thereof can be administered in any suitable-
      way, but are typically administered by continuous infusion. Accordingly, increasing or
      decreasing a rate of administration can be accomplished by changing the rate of flow of an
      intravenous drip, changing the concentration of the agent in an intravenous drip, etc. However;
30 the manner in which the rate of administration is changed will depend on the mode of",
      administration of the therapeutic. Where the therapeutic is administered transmucosally or
      transdermally, the rate may be increased by changing to a higher-release-rate patch or
      transdermal composition for example. Where the therapeutic is administered orally, the rate

                                           42
   EP 20 764 639.9  DESCRIPTION (08.05.2025)  35 -36
                             35

   may be increased by switching to a higher-dose form, administering additional doses, or
   administering controlled-release dosage forms with a higher rate of release, for example.

        Where the therapeutic is administered by inhalation, the rate may be increased by administering
   5 additional boluses, a more concentrated bolus, or a faster-release bolus, for example. Other

       modes of administration (via subcutaneous injection pump, suppository, etc.) can be modulated
       in analogous fashions, and decreasing the rate of administration can be accomplished by doing
        the opposite of an action that would increase the rate of administration of the therapeutic.

   10 Also described herein is an angiotensin-receptor-agonist and/ or a precursor thereof for use in
         the treatment of shock in a subject that either runs into shock or that has developed shock,
         wherein said Angiotensin-Receptor-Agonist and/ or a precursor thereof is Angiotensin II that

   20 continuous intravenous infusion.

:        In another specific embodiment of the invention for titration of angiotensin II the blood pressure.
         response (e.g. mean arterial pressure; MAP) is monitored. Titration of angiotensin II may be
         carried out every 60 minutes, more preferred every 45 minutes, even more preferred every 30
   25 minutes, even more preferred every 15 minutes, even more preferred every 10 minutes, most

        preferred every 5 minutes. Angiotensin II titration may be carried out by increments of up to
         40 ng/kg/min, more preferred up to 20 ng/kg/min, most preferred up to
         15 ng/kg/min as needed to achieve or maintain target blood pressure. In another preferred
         embodiment the dosage should not exceed 80 ng/kg/min of angiotensin II during the first 3
   30 hours of treatment. It is most preferred that maintenance doses should not exceed

         40 ng/kg/min andd oses as low as 1.25 ng/kg/min may be used.

     Hg, about 45 mm Hg, about 50 mm Hg, 55 mm Hg, about 60 mm Hg, about

5 65 mm Hg, about 70 mm Hg, or about 75 mm Hg.

      In one embodiment, the patient may be receiving a vasopressor (e.g., a catecholamine, such as
     norepinephrine, a norepinephrine equivalent, epinephrine, dopamine, phenylephrine) or a -

     combination thereof. In some embodiments, the vasopressor is vasopressin (e.g., terlipressin,

10 argipressin, desmopressin, felypressin, lypressin, or ornipressin).

      Also described herein is an angiotensin-receptor-agonist and/ or a precursor thereof for use in
      the treatment of shock in a subject that either runs into shock or that has developed shock,
      wherein said angiotensin-receptor-agonist and/ or a precursor thereof, in particular Angiotensin
15 II, is administered in combination with an inhibitor of DPP3.

     Also described herein is an angiotensin-receptor-agonist and/ or a precursor thereof for use in
    the treatment of shock in a subject that either runs into shock or that has developed shock, , in
     combination with an inhibitor of DPP3, wherein said inhibitor of DPP3 is an antibody or
     fragment or scaffold that exhibits a minimum binding affinity to DPP3 of equal or less than 10-

5 7 M.

      In accordance with the present invention, the person skilled in the art is well aware that the
     binding affinity of the herein disclosed DPP3 binder to DPP3 may be measured by various
     suitable assays known in the art. Respective examples are given below, but these shall be not
10 construed as limiting possibilities to measure binding affinity of the herein disclosed DPP3

      binder to DPP3.

     For example, the binding affinity of the DPP3 binder to an epitope may be determined. A
     binding assay may be performed to detect and/or quantitate antibody binding to e.g. the
     immunization peptide of the respective binder. For example, this immunization peptide may be
15. immobilized upon a solid phase. The test sample (e.g. antibody solution) is passed over the
     immobile immunization peptide, and bound antibody can be detected. For the purposes of the
     present description, the term "solid phase" may be used to include any material or vessel in
     which.or on which the assay may be performed and includes, but is not limited to, porous

      materials, nonporous materials, test tubes, wells, slides, magnetic beads etc.

20

      Exemplary detection methods:

    - Label antibody before contacting with solid phase and detect respective label
        (fluorescence, chemiluminescence, enzymatic etc.).

    Use labeled secondary antibody against specific Fc part of sample-antibody. Incubate

25  solid phase bound antibody with secondary antibody (e.g. anti human IgG, anti murine

    IgG) and detect respective label (fluorescence, chemiluminescence, enzymatic etc.).

    Use a labeled antibody as competitor for solid phase binding (e.g. labeled AK1967).

    - Quantify binding affinity by decrease of signal.

30 Another method to determine the affinity of antibodies to DPP3, the kinetics of binding of DPP3
      to immobilized antibody may be determined by means of label-free surface plasmon resonance
      using a Biacore 2000 system (GE Healthcare Europe GmbH, Freiburg, Germany). Reversible

immobilization of the antibodies may be performed using an anti-mouse Fc antibody covalently
coupled in high density to a CM5 sensor surface (mouse antibody capture kit; GE Healthcare)
(Lorenz et al. 2011. Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 55(1): 165-173).

 5 Also described herein is an angiotensin-receptor-agonist and/ or a precursor thereof for use in
      the treatment of shock in a subject that either runs into shock or that has developed shock, in
      combination with an inhibitor of DPP3, wherein said inhibitor of DPP3 is an antibody or
      fragment or scaffold that is monospecific, in one embodiment said inhibitor of DPP3 is an
      antibody or fragment or scaffold that is monoclonal.

10

      Monospecific antibodies or fragments or non-Ig scaffolds according to the invention are
      antibodies or fragments or non-Ig scaffolds that all have affinity for the same antigen.
      Monoclonal antibodies are monospecific, but monospecific antibodies may also be produced

      less than 50% DPP3 activity in a liquid phase assay, preferably less than 40%, more preferably
      30 %. For definition of liquid phase assay see above. In one specific embodiment to prevent
      inhibition of DPP3 the capture-binder should not bind DPP3 in the area around the active center
      and substrate binding region (amino acids 316 - 669 of SEQ ID No. 1).

                                   39

        DPP3 activity assay to determine the inhibitory ability of possible capture-binders comprises
        the following steps:

        · Incubation of 25 ng/ ml native human DPP3 with 5 ug/ ml of the respective capture-

        binder and buffer control in 50 mM Tris-HCI, pH 7,5 and 100 AM ZnCl2 for 1 hour at

5       room temperature.

        · Addition of the fluorogenic substrate Arg-Arg-BNA (20 ul, 2 mM).

        · Incubation at 37  and monitoring the generation of free BNA in a Twinkle LB 970
           microplate fluorometer (Berthold Technologies GmbH) over 1 hour. Fluorescence of
            BNA is detected by exciting at 340 nm and measuring emission at 410 nm.

10      · Slopes (in RFU/ min) of increasing fluorescence of the different samples are calculated.

        The slope of native human DPP3 with buffer control is appointed as 100 % activity. The.

        inhibitory ability of a possible capture-binder is defined as the decrease of native human

        DPP3 activity by incubation with said capture-binder in percent.

     In a liquid phase assay samples of bodily fluids are directly subjected to fluorogenic substrates
15 (e.g. Arg-Arg-ß-NA). Since there are many different amino peptidases in the plasma (Sanderink

     et al. 1988), it is possible that the used substrate is cleaved by peptidases other than DPP3. To
     circumvent this problem one preferred method of detecting specific DPP3 activity is the use of
      an enzyme capture activity assay.

20.In one specific embodiment determination of active DPP3 in an enzyme capture assay
      comprises the steps:

        · Contacting said sample with a capture-binder that binds to full-length DPP3 but

        preferably inhibits DPP3 activity in a liquid phase assay less than 50%, preferably less

=       than 40%, more preferably 30 %. To prevent inhibition of DPP3 the capture-binder

     .  should not bind DPP3 in the area around the active center and substrate binding region          .

        · adding substrate of DPP3 to said separated DPP3,

        · quantifying DPP3 activity by measuring the conversion of the substrate of DPP3.

                          40

     An "antibody" according to the present invention is a protein including one or more
     polypeptides substantially encoded by immunoglobulin genes that specifically binds an antigen.
     The recognized immunoglobulin genes include the kappa, lambda, alpha (IgA), gamma (IgG1,
    IgG2, IgG3, IgG4), delta (IgD), epsilon (IgE) and mu (IgM) constant region genes, as well as the
5 myriad immunoglobulin variable region genes. Full-length immunoglobulin light chains are
     generally about 25 kDa or 214 amino acids in length.

      Full-length immunoglobulin heavy chains are generally about 50 kDa or 446 amino acids in
     length. Light chains are encoded by a variable region gene at the NH2-terminus (about 110
10 amino acids in length) and a kappa or lambda constant region gene at the COOH-terminus.
     Heavy chains are similarly encoded by a variable region gene (about 116 amino acids in length)
      and one of the other constant region genes.

      The basic structural unit of an antibody is generally a tetramer that consists of two identical
15 pairs of immunoglobulin chains, each pair having one light and one heavy chain. In each pair,

      the light and heavy chain variable regions bind to an antigen, and the constant regions mediate
      effector functions. Immunoglobulins also exist in a variety of other forms including, for
      example, Fv, Fab, and F(ab')2, as well as bifunctional hybrid antibodies and single chains (e.g.,

      Lanzavecchia et al., Eur. J. Immunol. 17:105.1987; Huston et al .; Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.
20 85:5879-5883, 1988; Bird et al., Science 242:423-426, 1988; Hood et al., Immunology,

       Benjamin, N.Y., 2nd ed., 1984; Hunkapiller and Hood, Nature 323:15-16,1986).

     An immunoglobulin light or heavy chain variable region includes a framework region
     interrupted by three hypervariable regions, also called complementarity determining regions
25 (CDR's) (see, Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, E. Kabat et al., U.S.
      Department of Health and Human 'Services, 1983). As noted above, the CDRs are primarily
     responsible for binding to an epitope of an antigen. An immune complex is an antibody, such
      as a monoclonal antibody, chimeric antibody, humanized antibody or human antibody, or

      functional antibody fragment, specifically bound to the antigen.

30

      "Chimeric antibodies" are antibodies whose light and heavy chain genes have been constructed,
      typically by genetic engineering, from immunoglobulin variable and constant region genes
     belonging to different species. For example, the variable segments of the genes from a mouse
      monoclonal antibody can be joined to human constant segments, such as kappa and gamma 1

                                       4
EP 20 764 639.9  DESCRIPTION (08.05.2025)  41 - 42
                          41

      or gamma 3. In one example, a therapeutic chimeric antibody is thus a hybrid protein composed
      of the variable or antigen-binding domain from a mouse antibody and the constant or effector
      domain from a human antibody, although other mammalian species can be used, or the variable
      region can be produced by molecular techniques. Methods of making chimeric antibodies are
 5 well known in the art, e.g., see U.S. Patent No. 5,807,715. A "humanized" immunoglobulin is
      an immunoglobulin including a human framework region and one or more CDRs from a non-
      human (such as a mouse, rat, or synthetic) immunoglobulin. The non-human immunoglobulin
      providing the CDRs is termed a "donor" and the human immunoglobulin providing the

      framework is termed an "acceptor."

 10

      In one embodiment of the invention, all the CDRs are from the donor immunoglobulin in a
      humanized immunoglobulin. Constant regions need not be present, but if they are, they must
      be substantially identical to human immunoglobulin constant regions, i.e., at least about
      85-90%, such as about 95% or more identical. Hence, all parts of a humanized immunoglobulin,
15 except possibly the CDRs, are substantially identical to corresponding parts of natural human
      immunoglobulin sequences.
      A "humanized antibody" in accordance with the invention is an antibody comprising a
      humanized light chain and a humanized heavy chain immunoglobulin. A humanized antibody
      binds to the same antigen as the donor antibody that provides the CDRs. The acceptor
20 framework of a humanized immunoglobulin or antibody may have a limited number of
      substitutions by amino acids taken from the donor framework. Humanized or other monoclonal
      antibodies can have additional conservative amino acid substitutions which have substantially
      no effect on antigen binding or other immunoglobulin functions. Exemplary conservative
      substitutions are those such as gly, ala; val, ile, leu; asp, glu; asn, gln; ser, thr; lys, arg; and phe,
25 tyr. Humanized immunoglobulins can be constructed by means of genetic engineering (e.g., see
      U.S. Patent No. 5,585,089). A human antibody is an antibody wherein the light and heavy chain
      genes are of human origin. Human antibodies can be generated using methods known in the art.
      Human antibodies can be produced by immortalizing a human B cell secreting the antibody of.
      interest. Immortalization can be accomplished, for example, by EBV infection or by fusing a
30 human B cell with a myeloma or hybridoma cell to produce a trioma cell. Human antibodies
      can also be produced by phage display methods (see, e.g., Dower et al., PCT Publication No.
      WO 91/17271; McCafferty et al., PCT Publication No. WO 92/001047; and Winter, PCT
      Publication No. WO 92/20791), or selected from a human combinatorial monoclonal antibody
      library (see the Morphosys website). Human antibodies can also be prepared by using

transgenic animals carrying a human immunoglobulin gene (for example, see Lonberg et al.,
PCT Publication No. WO 93/12227; and Kucherlapati, PCT Publication No. WO 91/10741).

     Thus, the anti-DPP3 antibody or anti-DPP3 antibody fragment in accordance with the invention
5 may have the formats known in the art. Examples are human antibodies, monoclonal antibodies,

    humanized antibodies, chimeric antibodies, CDR-grafted antibodies or antibody fragments
     thereof, but not limited to.

      In a specific embodiment of the invention the anti-DPP3 antibody is a monoclonal antibody or
10 a fragment thereof. In one embodiment of the invention the anti-DPP3 antibody or the

     anti-DPP3 antibody fragment is a human or humanized antibody or derived therefrom. In one
     specific embodiment one or more (murine) CDR's are grafted into a human antibody or
      antibody fragment.

15 In a preferred embodiment antibodies according to the present invention are recombinantly
      produced antibodies as e.g. IgG, a typical full-length immunoglobulin, or antibody fragments
      containing at least the F-variable domain of heavy and/or light chain as e.g. chemically coupled
      antibodies (fragment antigen binding) including but not limited to Fab-fragments including Fab
      minibodies, single chain Fab antibody, monovalent Fab antibody with epitope tags, e.g. Fab-

20 V5Sx2; bivalent Fab (mini-antibody) dimerized with the CH3 domain; bivalent Fab or
     multivalent Fab, e.g. formed via multimerization with the aid of a heterologous domain, e.g.
      via dimerization of dHLX domains, e.g. Fab-dHLX-FSx2; F(ab')2-fragments, scFv-fragments,
      multimerized multivalent and/or multispecific scFv-fragments, bivalent and/or bispecific
      diabodies, BITE® (bispecific T-cell engager), trifunctional antibodies, polyvalent antibodies,

25 e.g. from a different class than G; single-domain antibodies, e.g. nanobodies derived from
      camelid or fish immunoglobulines and numerous others.

In addition to anti-DPP3 antibodies or anti-DPP3 antibody fragments, other biopolymer

scaffolds, so called non-Ig scaffolds, are well known in the art to complex a target molecule           :

30 and have been used for the generation of highly target specific biopolymers. Examples are

aptamers, spiegelmers, anticalins and conotoxins.

Non-Ig scaffolds with the context of the invention may be protein scaffolds and may be used as
antibody mimics as they are capable to bind to ligands or antigens. Non-Ig scaffolds may be

      Kunitz domain based scaffolds (e.g. described in EP 1941867). Non-Ig scaffolds may be peptide

10 or oligonucleotide aptamers. Aptamers are usually created by selecting them from a large
     random sequence pool and are either short strands of oligonucleotides (DNA, RNA or XNA;
     Xu et al. 2010, Deng et al. 2014) or short variable peptide domains attached to a protein scaffold

      (Li et al. 2011).

      comprising Fv fragment, scFv fragment, Fab fragment, scFab fragment, F(ab)2 fragment and
      scFv-Fc Fusion protein. In another preferred embodiment the antibody format is selected from
      the group comprising scFab fragment, Fab fragment, scFv fragment and bioavailability
      optimized conjugates thereof, such as PEGylated fragments.

      With the context of the invention, the term "antibody" generally comprises monoclonal and
      polyclonal antibodies and binding fragments thereof, in particular Fc-fragments as well as so
      called "single-chain-antibodies" (Bird et al. 1988), chimeric, humanized, in particular

25 immunoglobulin-like proteins that are selected through techniques including, for example,
      phage display to specifically bind to the molecule of interest contained in a sample. In this
      context the term "specific binding" refers to antibodies raised against the molecule of interest
      or a fragment thereof. An antibody is considered to be specific, if its affinity towards the
      molecule of interest or the aforementioned fragment thereof is at least preferably 50-fold higher,
30 more preferably 100-fold higher, most preferably at least 1000-fold higher than towards other
      molecules comprised in a sample containing the molecule of interest. It is well known in the art
      how to make antibodies and to select antibodies with a given specificity.

      The amount of DPP3 protein and/ or DPP3 activity in a sample of bodily fluid of said subject
     may be determined by different methods, e.g. immunoassays, acitivity assays, mass
      spectrometric methods etc.

10 The amount of DPP3 protein and/ or DPP3 activity in a sample of bodily fluid of said subject
      may be determined for example by one of the following methods:

           1. Luminescence immunoassay for the quantification of DPP3 protein concentrations
                (LIA) (Rehfeld et al. 2019 JALM 3(6):943-953).

15 The LIA is a one-step chemiluminescence sandwich immunoassay that uses white high-binding
      polystyrene microtiter plates as solid phase. These plates are coated with monoclonal anti-DPP3
      antibody AK2555 (capture antibody). The tracer anti-DPP3 antibody AK2553 is labeled with
      MA70-acridinium-NHS-ester and used at a concentration of 20 ng per well. Twenty microliters
      of samples (e.g. serum, heparin-plasma, citrate-plasma or EDTA-plasma derived from patients'

20 blood) and calibrators are pipetted into coated white microtiter plates. After adding the tracer
      antibody AK2553, the microtiter plates are incubated for 3 h at room temperature and 600 rpm.

     Unbound tracer is then removed by 4 washing steps (350 uL per well). Remaining
      chemiluminescence is measured for 1s per well by using a microtiter plate luminometer. The

      concentration of DPP3 is determined with a 6-point calibration curve. Calibrators and samples
25 are preferably run in duplicate.

          2. Enzyme capture activity assay for the quantification of DPP3 activity (ECA) (Rehfeld

                et al. 2019 JALM 3(6):943-953).

      The ECA is a DPP3-specific activity assay that uses black high-binding polystyrene microtiter
30 plates as solid phase. These plates are coated with monoclonal anti-DPP3 antibody AK2555

      (capture antibody). Twenty microliters of samples (e.g. serum, heparin-plasma,
EP 20 764 639.9  DESCRIPTION (08.05.2025)  46 -47

                       46

      citrate-plasma, EDTA-plasma, cerebrospinal fluid and urine) and calibrators are pipetted into
      coated black microtiter plates. After adding assay buffer (200 uL), the microtiter plates are
     incubated for 2 h at 22 and 600 rpm. DPP3 present in the samples is immobilized by binding
     to the capture antibody. Unbound sample components are removed by 4 washing steps (350 u.L
5 per well). The specific activity of immobilized DPP3 is measured by the addition of the
      fluorogenic substrate, Arg-Arg-ß-Naphthylamide (Arg2-BNA), in reaction buffer followed by
     incubation at 37  for 1 h. DPP3 specifically cleaves Arg2-BNA into Arg-Arg dipeptide and
      fluorescent ß-naphthylamine. Fluorescence is measured with a fluorometer using an excitation
      wavelength of 340 nm and emission is detected at 410 nm. The activity of DPP3 is determined
10 with a 6-point calibration curve. Calibrators and samples are preferably run in duplicates.

          3. Liquid-phase assay for the quantification of DPP3 activity (LAA) (modified from Jones

                et al., Analytical Biochemistry, 1982).

      The LAA is a liquid phase assay that uses black non-binding polystyrene microtiter plates to
15 measure DPP3 activity. Twenty microliter of samples (e.g. serum, heparin-plasma, citrate-

     plasma) and calibrators are pipetted into non-binding black microtiter plates. After addition of
      fluorogenic substrate, Arg2-BNA, in assay buffer (200 uL), the initial BNA fluorescence (T=0)
      is measured in a fluorimeter using an excitation wavelength of 340 nm and emission is detected
      at 410 nm. The plate is then incubated at 37  for 1 hour. The final fluorescence of (T=60) is
20 measured. The difference between final and initial fluorescence is calculated. The activity of
      DPP3 is determined with a 6-point calibration curve. Calibrators and samples are preferably
      run in duplicates.

      A variety of immunoassays are known and may be used for the assays and methods of the
25 present. invention, these include: radioimmunoassays ("RIA"), homogeneous enzyme-

      multiplied immunoassays ("EMIT"), enzyme linked immunoadsorbent assays ("ELISA"),
      apoenzyme reactivation immunoassay ("ARIS"), chemiluminescence- and fluorescence-
      immunoassays, Luminex-based bead arrays, protein microarray assays, and rapid test formats
      such as for instance immunochromatographic strip tests ("dipstick immunoassays") and

      invention such an assay is an enzyme labeled sandwich assay. Examples of automated or fully
      automated assay comprise assays that may be used for one of the following systems: Roche
      Elecsys®, Abbott Architect®, Siemens Centauer®, Brahms Kryptor®, Biomerieux Vidas®,
 5 Alere Triage®.

      In one embodiment of the invention it may be a so-called POC-test (point-of-care), that is a test
      technology which allows performing the test within less than 1 hour near the patient without
      the requirement of a fully automated assay system. One example for this technology is the
      immunochromatographic test technology.

10 In a specific embodiment of the invention said POC-test combines the measurement of more
      than one analyte at the same time. In another specific embodiment of the invention said analyte
      is selected from the group of DPP3 and Pro-adrenomedullin or fragments thereof. In a very
      specific embodiment of the invention said POC-test combines the measurement of DPP3 and

       mature ADM.

15 In one embodiment of the invention at least one of the binders is labeled in order to be detected.

      In a preferred embodiment said label is selected from the group comprising chemiluminescent
      label, enzyme label, fluorescence label, radioiodine label.

      The assays can be homogenous or heterogeneous assays, competitive and non-competitive
      assays. In one embodiment, the assay is in the form of a sandwich assay, which is a
20 non-competitive immunoassay, wherein the molecule to be detected and/or quantified is bound
      to a first antibody and to a second antibody. The first antibody may be bound to a solid phase,
      e.g, a bead, a surface of a well or other container, a chip or a strip, and the second antibody is
      an antibody which is labeled, e.g. with a dye, with a radioisotope, or a reactive or catalytically
      active. moiety. The amount of labeled antibody bound to the analyte is then measured by an
25 appropriate method. The general composition and procedures involved with "sandwich assays"
      are well-established and known to the skilled person (The Immunoassay Handbook, Ed. David
       Wild, Elsevier. LTD, Oxford; 3rd ed. (May 2005), ISBN-13: 978-0080445267; Hultschig C et
       al., Curr Opin Chem Biol. 2006 Feb:10(1):4-10. PMID: 16376134).

      ·In another embodiment the assay comprises two capture molecules, preferably antibodies which
30 are both present as dispersions in a liquid reaction mixture, wherein a first labelling component

      is attached to the first capture molecule, wherein said first labelling component is part of a
      labelling system based on fluorescence- or chemiluminescence-quenching or amplification, and
EP 20 764 639.9  DESCRIPTION (08.05.2025)  48 -49

                        48

      a second labelling component of said marking system is attached to the second capture
     molecule, so that upon binding of both capture molecules to the analyte a measurable signal is
      generated that allows for the detection of the formed sandwich complexes in the solution
      comprising the sample.

 5 In another embodiment, said labeling system comprises rare earth cryptates or rare earth

      chelates in combination with fluorescence dye or chemiluminescence dye, in particular a dye
      of the cyanine type.

      In the context of the present invention, fluorescence based assays comprise the use of dyes,
      which may for instance be selected from the group comprising FAM (5-or
10 6-carboxyfluorescein), VIC, NED, Fluorescein, Fluoresceinisothiocyanate (FITC),
      IRD-700/800, Cyanine dyes, auch as CY3, CY5, CY3.5, CY5.5, Cy7, Xanthen, 6-Carboxy-
      2',4',7',4,7-hexachlorofluorescein (HEX), TET, 6-Carboxy-4',5'-dichloro-2',7'-
      dimethodyfluorescein (JOE), N,N,N',N'-Tetramethyl-6-carboxyrhodamine (TAMRA),
      6-Carboxy-X-rhodamine (ROX), 5-Carboxyrhodamine-6G (R6G5), 6-carboxyrhodamine-6G
15 (RG6), Rhodamine, Rhodamine Green, Rhodamine Red, Rhodamine 110, BODIPY dyes, such
      as BODIPY TMR, Oregon Green, Coumarines such as Umbelliferone, Benzimides, such as
      Hoechst 33258; Phenanthridines, such as Texas Red, Yakima Yellow, Alexa Fluor, PET,
      Ethidiumbromide, Acridinium dyes, Carbazol dyes, Phenoxazine dyes, Porphyrine dyes,
      Polymethin dyes, and the like.

20 In the context of the present invention, chemiluminescence based assays comprise the use of
      dyes, based on the physical principles described for chemiluminescent materials in (Kirk-

       Othmer, Encyclopedia of chemical technology, 4th ed., executive editor, J. I. Kroschwitz;
       editor, M. Howe-Grant, John Wiley & Sons, 1993, vol. 15. p. 518-562; incorporated herein by

      reference, including citations on pages 551-562). Preferred chemiluminescent dyes are

25 acridiniumesters.

     As mentioned herein, an "assay" or "diagnostic assay" can be of any type applied in the field
     of diagnostics. Such an assay may be based on the binding of an analyte to be detected to one
      or more capture probes with a certain affinity. Concerning the interaction between capture
      molecules and target molecules or molecules of interest, the affinity constant is preferably
30 greater than 108 M-1.

      DPP3 activity can be measured by detection of cleavage products of DPP3 specific substrates.
EP 20 764 639.9  DESCRIPTION (08.05.2025)  49 -50
                         49

      Known peptide hormone substrates include Leu-enkephalin, Met-enkephalin, endomorphin 1

     and 2, valorphin, ß-casomorphin, dynorphin, proctolin, ACTH (Adrenocorticotropic hormone)
      and MSH (melanocyte-stimulating hormone; Abramis et al. 2000, Barsun et al. 2007, Dhanda
      et al. 2008). The cleavage of mentioned peptide hormones as well as other untagged
 5 oligopeptides (e.g. Ala-Ala-Ala-Ala, Dhanda et al. 2008) can be monitored by detection of the
      respective cleavage products. Detection methods include, but are not limited to, HPLC analysis
      (e.g. Lee & Snyder 1982), mass spectrometry (e.g. Abramis et al. 2000), H1-NMR analysis (e.g.
      Vandenberg et al. 1985), capillary zone electrophoresis (CE; e.g. Barsun et al. 2007), thin layer
     chromatography (e.g. Dhanda et al. 2008) or reversed phase chromatography (e.g. Mazocco et
10 al. 2006).

      Detection of fluorescence due to hydrolysis of fluorogenic substrates by DPP3 is a standard

      procedure to monitor DPP3 activity. Those substrates are specific di- or tripeptides (Arg-Arg,
      Ala-Ala, Ala-Arg, Ala-Phe, Asp-Arg, Gly-Ala, Gly-Arg, Gly-Phe, Leu-Ala, Leu-Gly, Lys-Ala,

15 Phe-Arg, Suc-Ala-Ala-Phe) coupled to a fluorophore. Fluorophores include but are not limited
      to ß-naphtylamide (2-naphtylamide, BNA, 2NA), 4-methoxy-ß-naphtylamide
      (4-methoxy-2-naphtylamide) and 7-amido-4-methylcoumarin (AMC, MCA; Abramis et al.
      2000, Ohkubo et al. 1999). Cleavage of these fluorogenic substrates leads to the release of
      fluorescent ß-naphtylamine or 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin respectively. In a liquid phase assay

20 or an ECA substrate and DPP3 are incubated in for example a 96 well plate format and
      fluorescence is measured using a fluorescence detector (Ellis & Nuenke 1967). Additionally,
      DPP3 carrying samples can be immobilized and divided on a gel by electrophoresis, gels stained
      with fluorogenic substrate (e.g. Arg-Arg-BNA) and Fast Garnet GBC and fluorescent protein
      bands detected by a fluorescence reader (Ohkubo et al. 1999). The same peptides (Arg-Arg,

25 Ala-Ala, Ala-Arg, Ala-Phe, Asp-Arg, Gly-Ala, Gly-Arg, Gly-Phe, Leu-Ala,
      Leu-Gly, Lys-Ala, Phe-Arg, Suc-Ala-Ala-Phe) can be coupled to chromophores, such as.
      p-nitroanilide diacetate. Detection of color change due to hydrolysis of chromogenic substrates
      can be used to monitor DPP3 activity.

30 Another option for the detection of DPP3 activity is a Protease-GloTM Assay (commercially
      available at Promega). In this embodiment of said method DPP3 specific di- or tripeptides (Arg-
     Arg, Ala-Ala, Ala-Arg, Ala-Phe, Asp-Arg, Gly-Ala, Gly-Arg, Gly-Phe, Leu-Ala,
      Leu-Gly, Lys-Ala, Phe-Arg, Suc-Ala-Ala-Phe) are coupled to aminoluciferin. Upon cleavage

                                           4K
EP 20 764 639.9  DESCRIPTION (08.05.2025)  50 -51
                         50

by DPP3, aminoluciferin is released and serves as a substrate for a coupled luciferase reaction
that emits detectable luminescence.

    In a preferred embodiment DPP3 activity is measured by addition of the fluorogenic substrate
5 Arg-Arg-BNA and monitoring fluorescence in real time.

      In a specific embodiment of said method for determining active DPP3 in a bodily fluid sample
      of a subject said capture binder reactive with DPP3 is immobilized on a solid phase.

10 The test sample is passed over the immobile binder, and DPP3, if present, binds to the binder
      and is itself immobilized for detection. A substrate may then be added, and the reaction product
      may be detected to indicate the presence or amount of DPP3 in the test sample. For the purposes
      of the present description, the term "solid phase" may be used to include any material or vessel

      in which or on which the assay may be performed and includes, but is not limited to: porous
15 materials, nonporous materials, test. tubes, wells; slides, agarose resins

      (e.g. Sepharose from GE Healthcare Life Sciences), magnetic particals (e.g. DynabeadsTMM or
      PierceTM magnetic beads from Thermo Fisher Scientific), etc.

      Binders of protein or peptide origin (e.g. antibody, antibody fragments, non-Ig scaffold) are
20 immobilized onto the solid phase by methods comprising: physical adsorption (e.g. by

      electrostatic interaction or hydrophobic interaction), bioaffinity immobilization (e.g. avidin-
      biotin, protein A/ G/ L, His-tag and Ni2+-NTA, GST-tag and gluthatione, DNA hybridization,
      aptamers), covalent bond (e.g. amine and N-hydroxysuccinimide) or a combination of said
      immobilization methods (Kim & Herr 2013). Binders of oligonucleotide origin.
25 (e.g. aptamers) may be immobilized onto the solid phase by utilization of the (strept)avidin-
      biotin system (Müller et al: 2012, Deng et al. 2014).

      In a specific embodiment of said method for determining DPP3 activity in a bodily fluid sample
     of a subject said separation step is a washing step that removes ingredients of the sample that
30 are not bound to said capture-binder from the captured DPP3. That separation step can be any
      other step that separates DPP3 bound to said capture-binder from the ingredients of said bodily
      fluid sample.

    In a specific embodiment of said method for determining DPP3 activity in a bodily fluid sample

    of a subject said DPP3 substrate conversion by immobilized DPP3 is measured (detected) by a

     method selected from the group comprising: fluorescence of fluorogenic substrates (e.g. Arg-
     Arg-BNA, Arg-Arg-AMC), color change of chromogenic substrates, luminescence of substrates
5 coupled to aminoluciferin (Promega Protease-GloTM Assay), mass spectrometry, HPLC/ FPLC
     (reversed phase chromatography, size exclusion chromatography), thin layer chromatography,
     capillary zone electrophoresis, gel electrophoresis followed by activity staining (immobilized,
    active DPP3) or western blot (cleavage products).

10 In a specific embodiment of said method for determining DPP3 acitivity in a bodily fluid sample
      of a subject said substrate may be selected from the group comprising:

      Leu-enkephalin, Met-enkephalin, endomorphin 1 and 2, valorphin, B-casomorphin, dynorphin,
      proctolin, ACTH and MSH, or di- and tri-peptides coupled to a fluorophore, a chromophore or
      aminoluciferin (Promega Protease-GloTMM Assay). Di- or tripeptides that are cleaved by DPP3

15 include, but are not limited . to, Arg-Arg, Ala-Ala, Ala-Arg, Ala-Phe,
                                                                                                                                                                          .
      Asp-Arg; Gly-Ala, Gly-Arg, Gly-Phe, Leu-Ala, Leu-Gly, Lys-Ala, Phe-Arg, Suc-Ala-Ala-Phe.
      Fluorophores include but are not limited to ß-naphtylamide (2-naphtylamide, BNA, 2NA), 4-
      methoxy-B-naphtylamide (4-methoxy-2-naphtylamide) and 7-amido-4-methylcoumarin
      (AMC, MCA; Abramic et al. 2000, Ohkubo et al. 1999). Cleavage of these fluorogenic

20 substrates leads to the release of fluorescent B-naphtylamine or 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin
      respectively. Chromophores include but are not limited to p-nitroanilide diacetate (pNA). The
      hydrolysis of a peptide-pNA bond in the chromogenic substrates results in the release of pNA
      which in turn changes color. Thus, the change in absorbance (DA/min) is directly proportional
      to the enzymatic activity. Using the Protease-GloTM Assay from Promega, upon cleavage by

25 DPP3, aminoluciferin is released and serves as a substrate for a coupled luciferase reaction that

      emits detectable luminescence.

      Subject-matter of the present invention is also a method for prognosing an outcome and/or the
     risk of an adverse event in a subject that has developed refractory shock; wherein said method
30 is comprising the steps:

· determining the level of DPP3 in a sample of bodily fluid of said subject; said sample
    of bodily fluid is selected from the group of whole blood, plasma, and serum;

· comparing said level of determined DPP3 to a predetermined threshold,

    . correlating said level of DPP3 with said risk of an adverse event in said subject, wherein

    an elevated level above a certain threshold is predictive for an enhanced risk of said

    adverse events or,

    correlating said level of DPP3 with success of a therapy or intervention in said subject,

5   wherein a level below a certain threshold is predictive for a success of therapy or

    intervention.

     In the context of the present invention, the term "prognosis" denotes a prediction of how a
     patient's medical condition will progress. This may include an estimation of the chance of
10 recovery or the chance of an adverse event for said patient. Adverse event is defined as organ
      dysfunction or mortality. Organ dysfunction is defined as renal decline, cardiac dysfunction or
     liver dysfunction.

EXAMPLES

        Example 1 - Methods for the measurement of DPP 3 protein and DPP3 activity

 5 Generation of antibodies and determination DPP3 binding ability: Several murine antibodies
       were produced and screened by their ability of binding human DPP3 in a specific binding assay
       (see Table 1).

       Peptides/ conjugates for immunization:

       DPP3 peptides for immunization were synthesized, see Table 1, (JPT Technologies, Berlin,
10 Germany) with an additional N-terminal cystein (if no cystein is present within the selected

      DPP3-sequence) residue for conjugation of the peptides to Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA). The
      peptides were covalently linked to BSA by using Sulfolink-coupling gel (Perbio-science, Bonn,
      Germany). The coupling procedure was performed according to the manual of Perbio.
       Recombinant GST-hDPP3 was produced by USBio (United States Biological, Salem, MA,
15 USA).

       Immunization of mice, immune cell fusion and screening:

      Balb/c mice were intraperitoneally (i.p.) injected with 84 ug GST-hDPP3 or 100 ug
      DPP3-peptide-BSA-conjugates at day 0 (emulsified in TiterMax Gold Adjuvant), 84 µg or 100
      ug at day 14 (emulsified in complete Freund's adjuvant) and 42 ug or 50 µg at day 21 and 28
.20 (in incomplete Freund's adjuvant). At day 49 the animal received an intravenous (i.v.) injection
       of 42 µg GST-hDPP3 or 50 µg DPP3-peptide-BSA-conjugates dissolved in saline. Three days
       later the mice were sacrificed and the immune cell fusion was performed.

       Splenocytes from the immunized mice and cells of the myeloma cell line SP2/0 were fused with
       1 ml 50% polyethylene glycol for 30 s at 37. After washing, the cells were seeded in 96-well
25 cell culture plates. Hybrid clones were selected by growing in HAT medium [RPMI 1640
      culture medium supplemented with 20% fetal calf serum and HAT-Supplement]. After one
      week, the HAT medium was replaced with HT Medium for three passages followed by
       returning to the normal cell culture medium.

       The cell culture supernatants were primarily screened for recombinant DPP3 binding IgG
30 antibodies two weeks after fusion. Therefore, recombinant GST-tagged hDPP3 (USBiologicals,

       Salem, USA) was immobilized in 96-well plates (100 ng/ well) and incubated with 50 ul cell

      culture supernatant per well for 2 hours at room temperature. After washing of the plate, 50 ul
EP 20 764 639.9  DESCRIPTION (08.05.2025)  54 -55
                         54

       / well POD-rabbit anti mouse IgG was added and incubated for 1 h at RT. After a next washing

      step, 50 ul of a chromogen solution (3,7 mM o-phenylendiamine in citrate/ hydrogen phosphate

      buffer, 0.012% H2O2) were added to each well, incubated for 15 minutes at RT and the
      chromogenic reaction stopped by the addition of 50 ul 4N sulfuric acid. Absorption was

 5 detected at 490 mm.

      The positive tested microcultures were transferred into 24-well plates for propagation. After
      retesting the selected cultures were cloned and re-cloned using the limiting-dilution technique
       and the isotypes were determined.

       Mouse monoclonal antibody production

10 Antibodies raised against GST-tagged human DPP3 or DPP3-peptides were produced via
       standard antibody production methods (Marx et al. 1997) and purified via Protein A. The
       antibody purities were  90% based on SDS gel electrophoresis analysis.

        Characterization of antibodies - binding to hDPP3 and/ or immunization peptide

      To analyze the capability of DPP3/ immunization peptide binding by the different antibodies
15 and antibody clones a binding assay was performed:

              a) Solid phase

       Recombinant GST-tagged hDPP3 (SEQ ID NO. 1) or a DPP3 peptide (immunization peptide,
      SEQ ID NO. 2) was immobilized onto a high binding microtiter plate surface (96-Well
       polystyrene microplates, Greiner Bio-One international AG, Austria, 1 ug/well in coupling

20 buffer [50 mM Tris, 100 mM NaCl, pH7,8], 1h at RT). After blocking with 5% bovine serum

       albumin, the microplates were vacuum dried.

            b) Labelling procedure (Tracer)

       100 µg (100 µl) of the different antiDPP3 antibodies (detection antibody, 1 mg/ ml in PBS, pH
      7.4) were mixed with 10 ul acridinium NHS-ester (1 mg/ml in acetonitrile, InVent GmbH,
25 Germany; EP: 0 353 971) and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. Labelled antiDPP3
      antibody was purified by gel-filtration HPLC on Shodex Protein 5 um KW-803 (Showa Denko,
      Japan). The purified labeled antibody was diluted in assay buffer (50 mmol/l potassium
      phosphate, 100 mmol/l NaCl, 10 mmol/l Na2-EDTA, 5 g/l bovine serum albumin,
      1 g/l murine IgG, 1 g/l bovine IgG, 50 umol/l amastatin, 100 pmol/1 leupeptin, pH 7.4). The
30 final concentration was approx. 5-7*106 relative light units (RLU) of labelled compound

                                                   4K

      (approx. 20 ng labeled antibody) per 200 ul. acridinium ester chemiluminescence was measured
   · by using a Centro LB 960 luminometer (Berthold Technologies Gmbh & Co. KG).

            c) hDPP3 binding assay

      The plates were filled with 200 ul of labeled and diluted detection antibody (tracer) and
 5 incubated for 2-4 h at 2-8 . Unbound tracer was removed by washing 4 times with 350 ul

      washing solution (20 mM PBS, pH 7.4, 0.1 % Triton X-100). Well-bound chemiluminescence
      was measured by using the Centro LB 960 luminometer (Berthold Technologies Gmbh & Co.
      KG).

       Characterization of antibodies - hDPP3-inhibition analysis

10 To analyze the capability of DPP3 inhibition by the different antibodies and antibody clones a
      DPP3 activity assay with known procedure (Jones et al., 1982) was performed. Recombinant
      GST-tagged hDPP3 was diluted in assay buffer (25 ng/ ml GST-DPP3 in 50 mM Tris-HCl,
      pH7,5 and 100 µM ZnCl2) and 200 ul of this solution incubated with 10 µg of the respective
      antibody at room temperature. After 1 hour of pre-incubation, fluorogenic substrate Arg-Arg-

15 sNA (20 ul, 2mM) was added to the solution and the generation of free BNA over time was
      monitored using the Twinkle LB 970 microplate fluorometer (Berthold Technologies GmbH &
      Co. KG) at 37 . Fluorescence of ßNA is detected by exciting at 340 nm and measuring
      emission at 410 nm. Slopes (in RFU/ min) of increasing fluorescence of the different samples
      are calculated. The slope of GST-hDPP3 with buffer control is appointed as 100 % activity.

20 The inhibitory ability of a possible capture-binder is defined as the decrease of GST-hDPP3
      activity by incubation with said capture-binder in percent.

      The following table represents a selection of obtained antibodies and their binding rate in
      Relative Light Units (RLU) as well as their relative inhibitory ability (%; table 1). The
      monoclonal antibodies raised against the below depicted DPP3 regions, were selected by their
25 ability to bind recombinant DPP3 and/ or immunization peptide, as well as by their inhibitory

       potential.

      All antibodies raised against the GST-tagged, full length form of recombinant hDPP3 show a
      strong binding to immobilized GST-tagged hDPP3. Also antibodies raised against the SEQ ID
      NO .: 2 peptide.bind to GST-hDPP3. The SEQ ID NO .: 2 antibodies also strongly bind to the
30 immunization peptide.

5 The development of a luminescence immunoassay for the quantification of DPP3 protein
     concentrations (DPP3-LIA) as well as an enzyme capture activity assay for the quantification
     of DPP3 activity (DPP3-ECA) have been described recently (Rehfeld et al. 2018. JALM. in
     press), which is incorporated here in its entirety by reference.

10 Example 2 - DPP3 for prognosis of short-term mortality

      DPP.3 concentration in plasma of patients with sepsis/ septic shock and cardiogenic shock was
      determined and related to the short term-mortality of the patients.
      Study Cohort - Sepsis/Septic Shock
15 In 574 plasma samples from patients of the Adrenomedullin and Outcome in Severe Sepsis and
      Septic Shock (AdrenOSS) study DPP3 was measured. AdrenOSS is a prospective,
      observational, multinational study including 583 patients admitted to the intensive care unit
EP 20 764 639.9  DESCRIPTION (08.05.2025)  57 -58

                        57

     with sepsis or septic shock (Hollinger et al .. 2018). 292 patients were diagnosed with septic

      shock.

     Study Cohort - Cardiogenic Shock

     Plasma samples from 108 patients that were diagnosed with cardiogenic shock were screened
5 for DPP3. Blood was drawn within 6 h from detection of cardiogenic shock. Mortality was

     followed for 7 days.

       hDPP3 immunoassay:

      An immunoassay (LIA) or an activity assays (ECA) detecting the amount of human DPP3 (LIA)
10 or the activity of human DPP3 (ECA), respectively, was used for determining the DPP3 level

      in patient plasma. Antibody immobilization, labelling and incubation were performed as
      described in Rehfeld et al. (Rehfeld et al. 2018).

      Results
15 Short-term patients' survival in sepsis patients was related to the DPP3 plasma concentration at

      admission. Patients with DPP3 plasma concentration above 40.5 ng/ml (3rd Quartile) had an
      increased mortality risk compared to patients with DPP3 plasma concentrations below this
      threshold (Figure 1A). Applying this cut-off to the subcohort of septic shock patients, revealed
      an even more pronounced risk for short-torm mortality in relation to high DPP3 plasma
20 concentrations (Figure 1B). When the same cut-off is applied to patients with cardiogenic
      shock, also an increased risk for short-term mortality within 7 days is observed in patients with
      high DPP3 (Figure 1C).

      Example 3 - Purification of human native DPP3

25

     Human erythrocyte lysate was applied on a total of 100 ml of Sepahrose 4B resin (Sigma-
      Aldrich) and the flow through was collected. The resin was washed with a total of 370 mL PBS
      buffer, pH 7.4 and the wash fraction was combined with the collected flow through, resulting

      in a total volume of 2370 mL.

30 For the immuno-affinity purification step, 110 mg of monoclonal anti-hDPP3 mAb AK2552
      were coupled to 25.5 mL of UltraLink Hydrazide Resin (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according
      to the manufacturer's protocol (GlycoLink Immobilization Kit, Thermo Fisher Scientific). The
      coupling efficiency was 98%, determined by quantification of uncoupled antibody via

      Bradford-technique. The resin-antibody conjugate was equilibrated with 10 bed volumes of
      wash-binding buffer (PBS, 0.1% TritonX-100, pH 7.4), combined with 2370 mL of cleared red
      blood cell lysate and incubated at 4 under continuous stirring for 2h. Consequently, 100 mL
      of the incubation mixture was spread on ten 15 mL polypropylene columns and the flow-
5 through was collected by centrifugation at 1000xg for 30 seconds. This step was repeated
      several times resulting in 2.5 mL of DPP3-loaded resin per column. Each column was washed
      5 times with 10 mL of wash-binding buffer using the gravity-glow approach. DPP3 was eluted
     by placing each column in 15-mL falcon tube containing 2 mL of neutralization buffer (1M
      Tris-HCl, pH 8.0), followed by addition of 10 mL of elution buffer (100 mM Glycine-HCl,
10 0.1% TritonX-100, pH 3.5) per column and immediate centrifugation for 30 seconds at 1000xg ..
     The elution step was repeated 3 times in total resulting in 360 mL of combined eluates. The pH
      of the neutralized eluates was 8.0.

      The combined eluates were loaded on a 5 mL HiTrap Q-sephare HP column (GE Healthcare)
      equilibrated with IEX-buffer A1 (100 mM Glycine, 150 mM Tris, pH 8.0) using the sample
15 pump of the Akta Start system (GE Healthcare). After sample loading, the column was washed
      with five column volumes of IEX Buffer A2 (12 mM NaH2PO4, pH 7.4) to remove unbound
     protein. Elution of DPP3 was achieved by applying a sodium chloride gradient over 10 column
      volumes (50 mL) in a range of 0 - 1 M NaCl using IEX-buffer B (12 mM NaH2PO4,1 M NaCl,
      pH 7.4). The eluates were collected in 2 mL fractions. Buffers used for ion exchange
20 chromatography were sterile filtered using a 0.22 uM bottle-top filter.

A purification table with the respective yields and activities of each purification step is given
in table 2. Figure 2 shows an SDS-PAGE on a gradient gel (4-20%) of native hDPP3 purified

10 Example 4 - Effect of native DPP3 in an animal model

      The effect of native hDPP3 injection in healthy mice was studied by monitoring the shortening

       fraction and renal resistive index. .

      Wild type Black 6 mice (8-12 weeks, group size refer to table 3) were acclimated during 2
15 weeks and a baseline echocardiography was done. The mice were randomly allocated to one of

      the two groups and, subsequently, native DPP3 protein or PBS were injected intravenously via
      a retro-orbital injection with a dose of 600 µg/kg for DPP3 protein.

      After DPP3 or PBS injection, cardiac function was assessed by echocardiography (Gao et al.
20 2011) and renal function assessed by renal resistive index (Lubas et al., 2014, Dewitte et al.

      2012) at 15, 60 and 120 minutes (Figure 3).

      The mice treated with native DPP3 protein show significantly reduced shortening fraction

      displays worsening renal function as observed by the renal resistive index increase (Figure 4B).

      Antibodies raised against SEQ ID NO. 2 were characterized in more detail (epitope mapping,

     binding affinities, specificity, inhibitory potential). Here the results for clone 1967 of SEQ ID
      NO .: 2 (AK1967; "Procizumab") are shown as an example.

      Determination of AK1967 epitope on DPP3:

 5 For epitope mapping of AK1967 a number of N- or C-terminally biotinylated peptides were
      synthesized (PE GmbH, Hennigsdorf, Germany). These peptides include the sequence of the
      full immunization peptide (SEQ ID No. 2) or fragments thereof, with stepwise removal of one
      amino acid from either C- or N-terminus (see table 5 for a complete list of peptides).

      High binding 96 well plates were coated with 2 µg Avidin per well (Greiner Bio-One
10 international AG, Austria) in coupling buffer (500 mM Tris-HCI, pH 7.8, 100 mM NaCl).

     Afterwards plates were washed and filled with specific solutions of biotinylated peptides
      (10 ng/ well; buffer - 1xPBS with 0.5% BSA). Anti-DPP3 antibody AK1967 was labelled with

      a chemiluminescence label according to Example 1. .

      The plates were filled with 200 ul of labeled and diluted detection antibody (tracer) and
15 incubated for 4 h at room temperature. Unbound tracer was removed by washing 4 times with

      350 ul washing solution (20 mM PBS, pH 7.4, 0.1 % Triton X-100). Well-bound
      chemiluminescence was measured by using the Centro LB 960 luminometer (Berthold
      Technologies Gmbh & Co. KG). Binding of AK1967 to the respective peptides is determined
      by evaluation of the relative light units (RLU). Any peptide that shows a significantly higher
20 RLU signal than the unspecific binding of AK1967 is defined as AK1967 binder. The
      combinatorial analysis of binding and non-binding peptides reveals the specific DPP3 epitope

       of AK1967.

Determination of binding affinities using Octet:

25 The experiment was performed using Octet Red96 (ForteBio). AK1967 was captured on kinetic

grade anti-humanFc (AHC) biosensors. The loaded biosensors were then dipped into a dilution
series of recombinant GST-tagged human DPP3 (100, 33.3, 11.1, 3.7 nM). Association was

observed for 120 seconds followed by 180 seconds of dissociation. The buffers used for the

experiment are depicted in table 4. Kinetic analysis was performed using a 1:1 binding model

30 and global fitting.

Western Blot analysis of Binding specificity of AK1967:

     Blood cells from human EDTA-blood were washed (3x in PBS), diluted in PBS and lysed by
5 repeated freeze-thaw-cycles. The blood cell lysate had a total protein concentration of

     250 µg/ml, and a DPP3 concentration of 10 µg/ml. Dilutions of blood cell lysate (1:40, 1:80,
      1:160 and 1:320) and of purified recombinant human His-DPP3 (31.25-500 ng/ml) were
      subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western Blot. The blots were incubated in 1.) blocking buffer
      (1xPBS-T with 5% skim milk powder), 2.) primary antibody solution (AK1967 1:2.000 in
10 blocking buffer) and 3.) HRP labelled secondary antibody (goat anti mouse IgG, 1:1.000 in
      blocking buffer). Bound secondary antibody was detected using the Amersham ECL Western
      Blotting Detection Reagent and the Amersham Imager 600 UV (both from GE Healthcare).

      DPP3 inhibition assay:

      To analyze the capability of DPP3 inhibition by AK1967 a DPP3 activity assay with known
15 procedure (Jones et al., 1982) was performed as described in example 1. The inhibitory ability

     AK1967 is defined as the decrease of GST-hDPP3 activity by incubation with said antibody in
     percent. The resulting lowered DPP3 activities are shown in an inhibition curve in Figure 1C.

Epitope mapping:

      The analysis of peptides that AK1967 binds to and does not bind to revealed the DPP3 sequence
20 INPETG (SEQ ID No .: 3) as necessary epitope for AK1967 binding (see table 5).

Table 5: Peptides used for Epitope mapping of AK1967

       Binding affinity:

      AK1967 binds with an affinity of 2.2*10-9 M to recombinant GST-hDPP3 (kinetic curves see
 5 Figure 5).

       Specificity and inhibitory potential:

      The only protein detected with AK1967 as primary antibody in lysate of blood cells was DPP3
      at 80 kDa (Figure 6). The total protein concentration of the lysate was 250 µg/ml whereas the
      estimated DPP3 concentration is about 10 µg/ml. Even though there is 25 times more unspecific
10 protein in the lysate, AK1967 binds and detects specifically DPP3 and no other unspecific
      binding takes place.
      AK1967 inhibits 15 ng/ ml DPP3 in a specific DPP3 activity assay with an IC50 of about
       15 ng/ml (Figure 7).

       Chimerization/ Humanization:

15 The monoclonal antibody AK1967 ("Procizumab"), with the ability of inhibiting DPP3 activity
      by 70 %, was chosen as possible therapeutic antibody and was also used as template for

       chimerization and humanization.

       Humanization of murine antibodies may be conducted according to the following procedure:

20 For humanization of an antibody of murine origin the antibody sequence is analyzed for the
      structural interaction of framework regions (FR) with the complementary determining regions

                                          4º
EP 20 764 639.9  DESCRIPTION (08.05.2025)  63 -64
                          63

     (CDR) and the antigen. Based on structural modelling an appropriate FR of human origin is

      selected and the murine CDR sequences are transplanted into the human FR. Variations in the
      amino acid sequence of the CDRs or FRs may be introduced to regain structural interactions,
      which were abolished by the species switch for the FR sequences. This recovery of structural
 5 interactions may be achieved by random approach using phage display libraries or via directed
      approach guided by molecular modeling (Almagro and Fransson, 2008. Humanization of
      antibodies. Front Biosci. 13:1619-33).

      With the above context, the variable region can be connected to any subclass of constant regions
      (IgG, IgM, IgE: IgA), or only scaffolds, Fab fragments, Fv, Fab and F(ab)2. In example 6 and
10 7 below, the murine antibody variant with an IgG2a backbone was used. For chimerization and
      humanization a human IgGlk backbone was used.

      For epitope binding, only the CDRs are of importance. The CDRs for the heavy chain and the
      light chain of the murine anti-DPP3 antibody (AK1967) are shown in SEQ ID No. 6, SEQ ID
      No. 7 and SEQ ID No. 8 for the heavy chain and SEQ ID No. 9, sequence KVS and SEQ ID
15 No. 10 for the light chain, respectively. Sequencing of the anti-DPP3 antibody (AK1967)
      revealed an antibody heavy chain variable region (H chain) according to SEQ ID No .: 11 and
      an antibody light chain variable region (L chain) according to SEQ ID No .: 12.

       Example 6 - Effect of Procizumab in septic shock-induced heart failure

20

      In this experiment, the effect of Procizumab injection in sepsis-induced heart failure rats
      (Rittirsch et al. 2009) was studied by monitoring the shortening fraction.

       Cecal ligation puncture (CLP) model of septic shock:

      Male Wistar rats (2-3 months, 300 to 400 g, group size refers to table 6) from the Centre
25 d'élevage Janvier (France) were allocated randomly to one of three groups. All animals were

      anesthetized using ketamine hydrochloride (90 mg/ kg) and xylazine (9 mg/ kg) intra-
      peritoneally (i.p.). For induction of polymicrobial sepsis, CLP was performed using Rittirsch's
      protocol with minor modifications. A ventral midline incision (1.5 cm) was made to allow
      exteriorization of the cecum. The cecum is then ligated just below the ileocecal valve and
30 punctured once with an 18-gauge needle. The abdominal cavity is then closed in two layers,
      followed by fluid resuscitation (3 ml/ 100 g body of weight of saline injected subcutaneously)
      and returning the animal to its cage. Sham animals were subjected to surgery, without getting

EP 20 764 639.9                       DESCRIPTION (08.05.2025)             64 ->65

                                            64

their cecum punctured. CLP animals were randomized between placebo and therapeutic
antibody.

Study design:

      The study flow is depicted in Figure 8. After CLP or sham surgery the animals were allowed to
 5 rest for 20 hours with free access to water and food. Afterwards they were anesthetized,

      tracheotomy done and arterial and venous line laid. At 24 hours after CLP surgery either
      AK1967 or vehicle (saline) were administered with 5 mg/kg as a bolus injection followed by a
      3h infusion with 7.5 mg/kg. As a safety measure, hemodynamics were monitored invasively
      and continuously from t = 0 till 3 h.

10 At t=0 (baseline) all CLP animals are in septic shock and developed a decrease in heart function
      (low blood pressure, low shortening fraction). At this time point Procizumab or vehicle (PBS)
      were injected (i.v.) and saline infusion was started. There were 1 control group and 2 CLP
     groups which are summarized in the table below (table 6). At the end of the experiment, the

      animals were euthanized, and organs harvested for subsequent analysis.

Invasive Blood Pressure:

      Hemodynamic variables were obtained using the AcqKnowledge system (BIOPAC Systems,
      Inc., USA). It provides a fully automated blood pressure analysis system. The catheter is
20 connected to the BIOPAC system through a pressure sensor.

      For the procedure, rats were anesthetized (ketamine and xylazine). Animals were moved to the
     heating pad for the desired body temperature to 37-37.5 . The temperature feedback probe
     was inserted into the rectum. The rats were placed on the operating table in a supine position.
      The trachea was opened and a catheter (16G) was inserted for an external ventilator without to
25 damage carotid arteries and vagus nerves. The arterial catheter was inserted into the right
      carotid artery. The carotid artery is separate from vagus before ligation. A central venous
      catheter was inserted through the left jugular vein allowing administration of PCZ or PBS.

                                                                4k

      Following surgery, the animals were allowed to rest for the stable condition prior to
      hemodynamic measurements. Then baseline blood pressure (BP) were recorded. During the
      data collection, saline infusion via arterial line was stopped.

       Echocardiography:

 5 Animals were anesthetized using ketamine hydrochloride. Chests were shaved and rats were
      placed in decubitus position. For transthoracic echocardiographic (TTE) examination a
      commercial GE Healthcare Vivid 7 Ultra-sound System equipped with a high frequency (14-
      MHz) linear probe and 10-MHz cardiac probe was used. All examinations were recorded
      digitally and stored for subsequent off-line analysis.

10 Grey scale images were recorded at a depth of 2 cm. Two-dimensional examinations were
      initiated in a parasternal long axis view to measure the aortic annulus diameter and the
      pulmonary artery diameter. M-mode was also employed to measure left ventricular (LV)
      dimensions and assess fractional shortening (FS%). LVFS was calculated as LV end-diastolic
      diameter - LV end-systolic diameter / LV end-diastolic diameter and expressed in %. The time

15 of end-diastole was therefore defined at the maximal diameter of the LV. Accordingly, end-
      systole was defined as the minimal diameter in the same heart cycle. All parameters were
      measured manually. Three heart cycles were averaged for each measurement.

      From the same parasternal long axis view, pulmonary artery flow was recorded using pulsed
      wave Doppler. Velocity time integral of pulmonary artery outflow was measured.

20 From an apical five-chamber view, mitral flow was recorded using pulsed Doppler at the level
      of the tip of the mitral valves.

      Results:
      The septic shock-induced heart failure rats treated with PBS (CLP+PBS). show reduced
      shortening fraction compared to the sham animals (Fig. 9A). The CLP+PBS group also displays
25 high mortality rate (Fig. 9B). In contrast, application of Procizumab to sep-induced heart failure
      rats improves shortening fraction (Fig. 9A) and drastically reduces the mortality rate (Fig. 9B).

       Example 7 - Effect of Procizumab on heart and kidney function

30 The effect of Procizumab in isoproterenol-induced heart failure in mice was studied by
      monitoring the shortening fraction and renal resistive index.

       Isoproterenol-induced cardiac stress in mice:

     Acute heart failure was induced in male mice at 3 months of age by two daily subcutaneous
      injections of 300 mg/kg of Isoproterenol, a non-selective ß-adrenergic agonist
      (DL-Isoproterenol hydrochloride, Sigma Chemical Co) (ISO) for two days (Vergaro et al.
5 2016). ISO dilution was performed in NaCl 0.9%. ISO-treated mice were randomly assigned to
      two groups (Table 7) and PBS or Procizumab (10 mg/kg) were injected intravenously after
      baseline echocardiography (Gao et al., 2011) and renal resistive index measurements (Lubas et
      al., 2014, Dewitte et al. 2012) were performed at day 3 (Figure 10 A and B).
      Cardiac function was assessed by echocardiography (Gao et al., 2011) and by the renal resistive
10 index (Lubas et al., 2014; Dewitte et al, 2012) at 1 hour, 6 hours and 24 hours (Figure 10 A and
     B). The group of mice that was injected with vehicle (PBS) instead of isoproterenol was
     subjected to no further pharmacological treatment and served as the control group (Table 7).

        Results:

      Application of Procizumab to isoproterenol-induced heart failure mice restores heart function
      within the first hour after administration (Fig. 11A). Kidney function of sick mice shows
      significant improvement at 6 hours post Procizumab injection and is comparable to the kidney
20 function of sham animals at 24 hours (Fig. 11B).

       Example 8 - DPP3 indicates vasopressor need and response to vasopressor therapy

Plasma samples from 292 patients that were diagnosed with septic shock from the AdrenOSS
(see example 2) study were screened for DPP3. Human DPP3 was measured as described in
Example 1.

 5 Results

      Patients with an increased need to vasopressor administration for more than 5 days had high
     plasma concentrations of DPP3 (Figure 12A). In contrast, patients that responded to
      vasopressor administration and where vasopressor administration could be discontinued within
      the first 5 days, had significantly reduced plasma DPP3 concentrations (Figure 12B). This
10 indicates that development of refractory shock and thus an increased need of vasopressor
      administration due to a diminished response of this therapy, is related to high DPP3 plasma
      concentrations in patients with septic shock.
      Patients with vasopressor-resistant refractory septic shock (noradrenaline >0.5 µg/kg/min)
      show significantly higher plasma DPP3 concentrations than compared to patients that required
15 noradrenaline doses of < 0.5 µg/kg/min (p<0.001) (Figure 16A). Moreover, the DPP3 plasma
      concentration was strongly associated with mortality in patients with vasopressor-resistant
      refractory septic shock (Figure 16B).

       Example 9 - DPP3 is related to refractory shock

20 DPP3 concentrations in plasma of cardiogenic shock patients were determined using a hDPP3
      immunoassay and related to the development of refractory shock.

      Study Cohort - Cardiogenic Shock
      Plasma samples from 57 patients that were diagnosed with cardiogenic shock after acute
      myocardial infarction were screened for DPP3. Human DPP3 was measured as described in
25 Example 1.

        Results

      Patients with a DPP3 plasma concentration above a certain threshold on admission (59.1 ng/ml;
      3rd quartile) developed refractory shock to a higher extent (47%) than patients with DPP3
30 plasma concentrations below 59.1 ng/ml (12%) (Figure 13).

Example 10 - DPP3 and bio-ADM indicate short-term mortality in shock

      DPP3 and bio-ADM concentrations in plasma of septic shock patients were determined using
      a hDPP3 and a bio-ADM immunoassay and related to the short term-mortality of the patients.

 5 Study Cohort - Septic Shock
      Plasma samples from 292 patients that were diagnosed with septic shock from the AdrenOSS
      study were screened for DPP3 and bio-ADM. Human DPP3 was measured as described in
      Example 1. Bio-ADM was measured as decribed in Weber et al. (Weber et al. 2017. JALM

       2(2): 1-4).

10

        Results

      Plasma concentrations of bio-ADM and DPP3 were measured in septic schock patients. Patients

     were grouped according to specific cut-offs determined to be the 3rd quartile of all measured
     plasma concentrations of the respective marker (Table 8). Equal numbers of patients had either
15 high DPP3 only or high bio-ADM only (15.4%), while a lesser extent showed elevated plasma

      concentrations in both, bio-ADM and DPP3 (9.6%).

Table 8: Patient numbers with low/high DPP3 and low/high bio-ADM. Cut-offs were assigned

based on the Q3 (highest 25%) for both.

20 Mortality within the first 4 weeks after admission was related to the bio-ADM and DPP3
      concentration on admission. Patients with either only a high bio-ADM or only a high DPP3
      plasma concentration had a substantial increased risk to die within the first 4 weeks compared
      to patients that had a plasma concentration of either bio-ADM (Figure 14A) or either DPP3
      (Figure 14B) below a certain threshold (3rd quartile). Survival in patients with high bio-ADM

25 was better than survival in patients with high DPP3.

When both markers, bio-ADM and DPP3, were combined, an even higher risk for short-term
mortality was identified in comparison to the mortality that was related to an increase of one of
both markers only (Figure 14C). Merely 28.6% of the patients with high bio-ADM and high-
DPP3 plasma concentrations survived the first 4 weeks after admission.

Example 11 - DPP3 and bio-ADM DPP3 indicates vasopressor need and response to
vasopressor therapy

     DPP3 and bio-ADM concentrations in plasma of septic shock patients were determined using
5 a hDPP3 and a bio-ADM immunoassay and related to the need for vasopressor therapy.

      Study Cohort - Septic Shock

     In 292 plasma samples from patients that were diagnosed with septic shock from the AdrenOSS
      study DPP3 and bio-ADM concentrations were measured. Human DPP3 was measured as
      described in Example 1. Bio-ADM was measured as decribed in Weber et al. (Weber et al.

10 2017. JALM 2(2): 1-4).

Results

Plasma concentrations of bio-ADM and DPP3 were measured in septic schock patients. Patients

were grouped according to specific cut-offs determined as the 3rd quartile of all measured

15 plasma concentrations of the respective marker in the septic shock cohort (low DPP3 < 48.4

ng/ml, low bio-ADM < 213 pg/mL; high bio-ADM  213 pg/mL; high DPP3  48.4 ng/ml).

Patients with high DPP3, but low bio-ADM plasma concentrations had a higher need for              .

consecutive vasopressor administration compared to patients with either low DPP3 + low bio-

ADM or low DPP3 + high bio-ADM (Figure 15; Table 9). In contrast, patients that had low

20 DPP3 and low bio-ADM plasma concentrations, or patients that had low DPP3, but high bio-

ADM plasma concentrations on admission could be discontinued of vasopressor administration

earlier than patients with high DPP3 plasma concentrations on admission (Figure 15; Table 9).

This indicates that vasopressor therapy in septic shock patients with high bio-ADM can be

discontinued earlier due to a better therapeutic response compared to septic shock patients with

25 high DPP3. These patients (high DPP3) need longer treatment with vasopressors due to non-

responsiveness.
