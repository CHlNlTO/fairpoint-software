In contrast patient which have a DPP31evel below a threshold indicating that the patient
is not in/going into refractory shock, shall be treated with vasopressors.

In the embodiments of the application (here 16) we described this again as a "method of
treatment". In fact, some of the patients mentioned in D3 would be treated with
vasopressors, but some (namely those with refractory shock) would not be treated with
vasopressors. These would be treated with therapies targeting DPP3 in the form of DPP3
inhibitors and/or angiotensin II agonists.

Thus, claim 13 is novel.
Inventive step

With regard to the lack of inventive step of claims 1 and 21 as well as 14 and 17, we would
like to comment that it is known in the prior art that DPP3 is generally increased in septic
as well as cardiogenic shock.

However, it cannot in any way be deduced therefrom that a distinction can be made
between patients having refractory and non-refractory shock.
Furthermore, this distinction gives rise to different treatment consequence, namely
stopping vasopressors and giving DPP3 inhibitors/ angiotensin II agonists in the event
of refractory shock. In the case of non-refractory shock, additional vasopressors would
be given.
Therefore, applicants submit that the present claims are inventive.
Applicant has shown when filing the application, that high DPP3 plasma concentrations
are associated with vasopressor-resistant refractory septic shock as well as with the
development of refractory shock in patients with cardiogenic shock. In other words, a
distinction can be made between patients having or developing refractory shock vs. non-
refractory shock. It is therefore plausible that DPP3 inhibitors may be used to treat
patients with refractory shock or to prevent refractory shock in shock patients,
respectively. We hereby submit additional data showing in an animal model that
refractory septic shock can be successfully treated using the monoclonal antibody
Proeizumab, which binds and inhibits circulating DPP3 aeitivity.

Data

A randomized, open-label, controlled study in 16 anesthetized and mechanically
ventilated pigs was performed. Septic shock was induced by fecal peritonitis.
Resuscitation with fluids, antimicrobial therapy and abdominal drainage was initiated
one hour after the onset of septic shock. Septic pigs were randomly allocated to receive
Proeizumab (on top of standard of care) or standard of care (norepinephrine and fluids)
to maintain mean arterial pressure between 65 and 75 mmHg for 12 h (Fig. A). Eight
females and eight male pigs were used in the experiment and gender was properly
balanced between treatment and standard of care arms.

The inclusion criteria for refractory shock were: animals in shock (BP <50 mmHg),
vasopressor dose of 0.2i1g/kg/ min at H1 (defining refractory shock). Three animals were
included in the Procizumab-treated arm (n=3) and compared to Placebo (n=6) (Fig. B).
Norepinephrine dose in ug/kg/min was recorded every hour from hour 1. While the
standard of care arm of animals in refractory shock had a significantly high
norepinephrine need, the Procizumab-treated animals were infused with significantly
lower norepinephrine doses required to achieve the same target mean arterial pressure
of 65 mmHg (Fig. B ). The difference between treated and standard of care arms became

These data clearly show, that refractory shock can be treated effectively with the DPP3
inhibitor Procizumab.

Applicants request that a patent is granted on basis of the currently pending
claims. As an auxiliary request applicants request oral proceedings in case
the Examining Division intends to rej ect the application. The representative
is prepared to discuss minor issues over the phone.
