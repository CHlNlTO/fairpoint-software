2 Invitation

        You are invited, within a non-extendable period of four months of notification of this

         communication,

2.1 to EITHER approve the text communicated above and verify the bibliographic data (Rule
        71(5) EPC)
       (1) by filing a translation of the claim(s) in the other two official languages of the EPO

                                                             Fee code                        EUR

(2a) by paying the fee for grant including the fee           007                             1080.00

          for publication                                                                         0.00

          minus any amount already paid (Rule 71a(5) EPC):

        minus any amount already paid (Rule 71a(5) EPC):                                          0.00
                                                                                                  0.00

EPO Form 2004C 10.24AUWF (02.06.2025)
Date 04.06.2025  Sheet 3                            Application No .: 20 764 639.9

Important: If the translations of the claims and fees have already been filed and paid respectively
in reply to a previous communication under Rule 71(3) EPC, e.g. in the case of resumption of
examination after approval (see Guidelines C-V, 6), agreement as to the text to be granted

(Rule 71a(1) EPC) must be expressed within the same time limit (e.g. by approving the text and
verifying the bibliographic data, by confirming that grant proceedings can go ahead with the

documents on file and/or by stating which translations of the claims already on file are to be used).

Note 1: See "Notes concerning fee payments" below.

Note 2: Any overpaid "minus" amounts will be refunded when the decision to grant (EPO Form
            2006A) has been issued.

Note 3:  For the calculation of the grant fee under Article 2(2), No. 7, RFees (old fee structure),

         the number of pages is determined on the basis of a clean copy of the application
         documents, in which text deleted as a result of any amendments by the examining

         division is not shown.

         Such clean copy is made available via on-line file inspection only.

2.2 OR, in the case of disapproval, to request reasoned amendments or corrections to the text
        communicated above or keep to the latest text submitted by you (Rule 71(6) EPC).

In this case the translations of the claims and fee payments mentioned under point 2.1 above are

NOT due.

The terms "amendment(s)" and "correction(s)" refer only to amendments or corrections of the
application documents and not of other documents (e.g. bibliographic data, the designation of the

inventor, etc.).

        If filing amendments, you must identify them and indicate the basis for them in the application as
        filed. Failure to meet either requirement may lead to a communication from the examining division
        requesting that you correct this deficiency (Rule 137(4) EPC).

2.3 Bibliographic data

        Where you request a change or correction of bibliographic data in response to the Rule 71(3)
        communication, this will not cause the sending of a further communication under Rule 71(3) EPC.
        You will still have to pay the fees and file translations in reply to the Rule 71(3) communication in
        the case of 2.1 above, unless you also file a reasoned request for amendments or corrections in
        response to the Rule 71(3) communication (see case 2.2 above).

3. Loss of rights

        If neither of the two possible actions above (see points 2.1 or 2.2) is performed in due time, the
        European patent application will be deemed to be withdrawn (Rule 71(7) EPC).

4. Further procedure

4.1 In the case of point 2.1 above

4.1.1 The decision to grant the European patent will be issued, and the mention of the grant of the
         patent will be published in the European Patent Bulletin, if the requirements concerning the
        translation of the claims and the payment of all fees are fulfilled and there is agreement as to the
        text to be granted (Rule 71a(1) EPC).

        Note on payment of the renewal fee:

If a renewal fee becomes due before the next possible date for publication of the mention of the
grant of the European patent, publication will be effected only after the renewal fee and any
additional fee have been paid (Rule 71a(4) EPC).

Under Article 86(2) EPC, the obligation to pay renewal fees to the European Patent Office
terminates with the payment of the renewal fee due in respect of the year in which the mention of
the grant of the European patent is published.

EPO Form 2004C 10.24AUWF (02.06.2025)
Date 04.06.2025  Sheet 4               Application No .: 20 764 639.9

        Note on payment of the designation fee(s):

         If the designation fee(s) become(s) due after the communication under Rule 71(3) EPC, the
         mention of the grant of the European patent will not be published until these fees have been paid
          (Rule 71a(3) EPC).

4.1.2 After publication, the European patent specification can be downloaded free of charge from the
         EPO publication server https://data.epo.org/publication-server.

4.1.3 Filing of translations in the contracting states

        As regards translation requirements prescribed by the contracting states under Article 65(1) EPC,

         please consult the website of the European Patent Office
        www.epo.org -> Law & practice -> Legal texts, National law relating to the EPC
        www.epo.org -> Law & practice -> All Legal texts -> London Agreement

         In the case of a valid extension or validation

        As regards translation requirements prescribed by the extension or validation states, please
        consult the website of the European Patent Office
        www.epo.org -> Law & practice -> Legal texts, National law relating to the EPC

        Failure to supply a prescribed translation in a contracting state, or in an extension or
        validation state may result in the patent being deemed to be void ab initio in the state
        concerned (Art. 65(3) EPC).

4.2 In the case of 2.2 above

        If the present communication under Rule 71(3) EPC is based on an auxiliary request and, within
        the time limit, you maintain the main request or a higher ranking request which was not found
        allowable, the application may be refused (Art. 97(2) EPC).

        If the examining division gives its consent to the requested amendments or corrections, it will issue
         a new communication under Rule 71(3) EPC; otherwise, it shall resume the examination
        proceedings (Rule 71(6) EPC).

5. Filing of a divisional application

        Any divisional application relating to this European patent application must be filed directly with the
         European Patent Office in Munich, The Hague or Berlin and will be in the language of the
        proceedings for the present application, or if the latter was not in an official language of the EPO,
         the divisional application may be filed in the language of the present application as filed (see Article
        76(1) and Rule 36(2) EPC). Any such divisional application must be filed while the present
        application is still pending (Rule 36(1) EPC; Guidelines A-IV, 1.1.1).

6. Notes concerning fee payments
6.1 Making payments

         For payments made via deposit account, please note that as from 1 December 2017 debit orders
         will only be carried out if filed in an electronically processable format (xml), using an accepted
         means of filing as laid down in the Arrangements for deposit accounts (ADA), published in the
         Supplementary publication in the Official Journal.

        All relevant information related to the modes of payment of fees to the EPO can be retrieved from
        the EPO website at "Making Payments".

6.2 Information concerning fee amounts

        Procedural fees are usually adjusted every two years, on even years, with effect from 1 April.
         Therefore, before making a payment, parties should verify the amounts actually due on the date of
         payment using the applicable version of the Schedule of fees and expenses, published as a
         Supplement to the Official Journal of the EPO, available on the EPO website (www.epo.org) at
        www.epo.org/schedule-of-fees. The "Schedule of fees" table allows the viewing, downloading
        and searching of individual fee amounts, both current and previous.

6.3 Note to users of the automatic debiting procedure

EPO Form 2004C 10.24AUWF (02.06.2025)
Date 04.06.2025                                       Sheet 5                   Application No .: 20 764 639.9

               The fee for grant, including the fee for publication, and any additional claims fees due under Rule
               71(4) EPC will be debited automatically on the date of filing of the translations of the claims, or on
               the last day of the period of this communication. However, if the designation fee(s) become(s) due

               as set out in Rule 71a(3) EPC and/or a renewal fee becomes due as set out in Rule 71a(4) EPC,

               these should be paid separately by another permitted way of payment in order not to delay the

               publication of the mention of the grant. The same applies in these circumstances to the payment of

               extension and validation fees.
