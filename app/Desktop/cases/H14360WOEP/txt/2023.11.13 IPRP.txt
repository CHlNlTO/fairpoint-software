        [1] D1: CN 112527567 A (19 March 2021)

        [2] D2: CN 102982085 A (20 March 2013)

        [3] D1 discloses a system disaster recovery method, apparatus and device, and a storage medium (description,
              paragraphs [0020]-[0072]). A system 101 comprises a controller 1011, a cluster 1012, and a cluster 1013.
              The controller 1011 may send a control instruction to the cluster 1012 and the cluster 1013, so as to
             control the cluster 1012 and the cluster 1013 to execute various operations, for example, performing data
              synchronization. One of the cluster 1012 and the cluster 1013 is a main cluster, and the other is a backup
              cluster. The main cluster and the backup cluster can be converted in a certain condition, for example, when
              there is a fault in a cluster, the backup cluster can become a main cluster, and after recovery, the faulty
             cluster may become a backup cluster. The main cluster and the backup cluster may be two clusters with the
             same configuration. In order to ensure the normal provision of a service, clusters can synchronize data in
             real time therebetween, or back up data according to a preset rule. The system disaster recovery method is
              executed by the controller 1011. The method comprises: an execution subject sending a synchronization
              instruction to a backup cluster; after receiving the above-mentioned synchronization instruction, the
             backup cluster synchronizing data from a main cluster in real time; according to the number of available
              nodes in the main cluster, the number of nodes in the main cluster, and a preset proportion threshold,
              determining whether there is a fault in the main cluster; in response to determining that there is a fault in
              the main cluster, outputting first alarm information, controlling the backup cluster to stop synchronizing
              data from the main cluster, and determining whether the backup cluster is available; in response to
              determining that the backup cluster is available, acquiring address information of the backup cluster;
              modifying cluster configuration information according to the address information of the backup cluster;
             outputting the modified cluster configuration information to a user of the main cluster by means of a
              preset interface, such that the user uses the backup cluster according to the modified cluster configuration
              information; and in response to determining that the fault in the main cluster is recovered, controlling the
             main cluster to synchronize data from the backup cluster, wherein the synchronization may be incremental
              backup, so as to ensure the consistency of the data of the two clusters.

        [4] The difference between claims 1 and 17 and D1 lies in: a control device controlling, according to a first
             data backup policy, a main cluster or a standby cluster to back up a plurality of data sets, which are in the
              main cluster at a first moment and are related to a first service, to the standby cluster, wherein the first data
              backup policy comprises information of the plurality of data sets, which are related to the first service, and

               the first moment.

        [5] The differences between claim 13 and D1 lie in: an instruction comprising information of a plurality of
              data sets, which are related to a first service, and a first moment; and a main cluster backing, according to
             the instruction, up the plurality of data sets which are in the main cluster at the first moment and are related

              to the first service, to the standby cluster.

        [6] D2 discloses a data migration system and method (description, paragraphs [0022]-[0050]). Service data,
              which needs to be migrated from a first data server cluster to a second data server cluster, is referred to
             as target data related to a service to be migrated. When data migration is prepared, first, a time point that
             has passed is selected to be referred to as a first time point for short, and then by means of an initial data

           time point by an application server, is imported into the second data server.

[7] It can be seen that D2 provides the motivation for the above-mentioned differences.

[8] Some of the additional features of claims 2-12, 14-16 and 18-28 are disclosed in D1, and the remaining
     features are customary means in the art.

[9] Therefore, claims 1-28 comply with PCT Article 33(2), but do not comply with PCT Article 33(3).
     Similarly, claims 29-32 comply with PCT Article 33(2), but do not comply with PCT Article 33(3).
