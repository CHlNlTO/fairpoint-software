3O  sending, by the control device, a fourth instruction to the primary cluster, wherein the fourth

    instruction instructs the primary cluster to synchronize user data to the secondary cluster, or

    obtaining, by the control device, user data stored in the primary cluster and the secondary

    cluster, and adjusting, by the control device based on the user data stored in the primary cluster,
    the user data stored in the secondary cluster.

         5. The method according to any one of claims 1 to 4, wherein the method further comprises:

         configuring, by the control device, the first data backup policy for the first service based on

    the information that is about the plurality of data sets related to the first service and that is entered

    by a user and the first moment.

         6. The method according to any one of claims 1 to 5, wherein the method further comprises:

         configuring, by the control device, a second data backup policy for a second service, wherein

    the second data backup policy comprises information about a plurality of data sets related to the

    second service and a second moment, and

10       controlling, by the control device based on the second data backup policy, the primary cluster

    or the secondary cluster to back up, to the secondary cluster, the plurality of data sets related to the

    second service that are in the primary cluster and that are at the second moment.

         7. The method according to any one of claims 1 to 6, wherein the plurality of data sets related

    to the first service comprise a data set processed or stored by a first component in the primary

15 cluster and a data set processed or stored by a second component in the primary cluster.

         8. The method according to any one of claims 1 to 7, wherein the control device comprises a

    primary client and a secondary client, the primary client is configured to detect first status

    information of the primary cluster, the secondary client is configured to detect second status

    information of the secondary cluster, and the method further comprises:

20       obtaining, by the control device, the first status information obtained through detection of the

    primary client and the second status information obtained through detection of the secondary client,

    and

         when the first status information indicates that the primary cluster is a secondary identity or

    the cluster fails, and the second status information indicates that the secondary cluster is a primary

25 identity, determining, by the control device, that the secondary client is a client accessed by an

    application.

         9. The method according to claim 8, wherein the method further comprises:

         prompting, by the control device, the user with information indicating that the primary cluster

    is faulty, and

3O       adjusting, by the control device, an identity of the secondary cluster from the secondary

    identity to the primary identity in response to an identity adjustment operation of the user for the

    secondary cluster.

         10. The method according to any one of claims 1 to 9, wherein the control device is deployed

    in an isolated manner from the primary cluster.

35       11. The method according to any one of claims 1 to 10, wherein a same clock source is set in

                                                     2
    the control device, the primary cluster, and the secondary cluster.

    12. The method according to any one of claims 1 to 11, wherein the primary cluster and/or

    the secondary cluster comprise/comprises a cluster constructed based on a hadoop architecture.
