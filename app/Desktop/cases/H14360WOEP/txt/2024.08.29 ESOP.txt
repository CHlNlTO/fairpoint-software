2.1    Claims 1 and 13 have been drafted as separate independent claims in the same
2.1.1  category, which is the method category.

2.1.2  Under Article 84 in combination with Rule 43(2) EPC, an application may
2.2    contain more than one independent claim in a particular category only if the
2.3    subject-matter claimed falls within one or more of the exceptional situations set
2.3.1  out in paragraph (a), (b) or (c) of Rule 43(2) EPC. This is not the case in the
       present application, however, for the following reason(s): the subject-matter of
       claim 13 comprises merely a subset of features of the features of claim 1.

       In the further prosecution of the application, failure to file an amended set of
       claims which complies with Rule 43(2) EPC, or to submit convincing arguments
       as to why the current set of claims does in fact comply with these provisions,
       may lead to refusal of the application under Article 97(2) EPC.

       According to claim 5, "the information that is about the plurality of data sets ..
       and that is entered by a user and the first moment" cannot be clearly
       understood. What does "..and the first moment" mean in the context of
       information which is entered by a user ?

       According to claim 8, last feature, first and second status information indicate
       the roles (secondary or primary identity) or the failure status of the primary
       cluster; and if this status-related precondition is given the control device
       determines that the secondary client is accessed by an application.

       It is not clear how a certain system state, which is described by a particular set
       of status information, established by each client, allows to determine that one of
       the clients are accessed by an application.

           identified as important data.
           Accordingly, a backup agent or server may set up a data protection policy
           to backup such highly available data."]

3.2 Thus, the subject-matter of independent claim 1 differs from this known from D1
          in that the selected data in the high availability cluster, the primary cluster, is
           backed up to a secondary (backup) cluster, while D1 teaches backing up the HA
          Data (145) to a Backup Data m (120) .

3.3 The objective technical problem to be solved might be formulated as how to
          enable more quickly restoring a service in case of a (primary cluster's) failure.

3.4 D2 teaches in section BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION, second
          paragraph, that a backup cluster of nodes is known and that "the backup cluster
           of nodes can operate as an independent file system to the primary cluster of
           nodes". It is apparent that, by providing the same structure for the backup
           system as for the primary system, data formatting and/or conversion is avoid,
          and service restoration in case of a failure of the primary cluster is faster.
          See also D3, disclosing in FIG. 1: (1012) is a primary cluster and (1013) is a
           backup (secondary) cluster.

3.5 Therefore, the present application does not meet the requirements of Article
          52(1) EPC, because the subject-matter of claim 1 does not involve an inventive
          step within the meaning of Article 56 EPC.

        "To ensure the normal provision of services, data can be synchronized
        between clusters in real time, or backed up according to pre-set rules";

        paragraph [0034]:

        "The backup cluster can synchronize data from the main cluster in real
        time to ensure that services can be provided at any time."]

4.2 Firstly, it is noted that "information about a plurality of data sets" is so broad that
           any service related data synchronization based on any rule (or policy in D1), as
           disclosed in D3, covers "information about a plurality of data sets".

        Thus, the subject-matter of claim 3 only differs, if at all, from the teaching of D1
        in that the data sets, backed up according to pre-set rules, are at a first moment
        (established).

4.3 The skilled person would effortlessly consider implementing the service related

        data synchronization or backup not necessarily instantly, but much more on a

        regular time basis, e.g. by copying point-in time based snapshots to the backup
        cluster, thereby arriving at the subject-matter of claim 13. A point-in-time
        snapshot based backup is a widely known and alternative technique replacing

        data synchronization or replication as required by the circumstances.

4.4     It follows that the subject-matter of claim 13 also does not involve an inventive

        step within the meaning of Article 56 EPC.

        Independent claims 17, 18 (Article 52(1), 56 EPC)

        The subject-matter of independent claims 17, 18 is equal in scope to the
        subject-matter of independent claim 1 respectively claim 13; the same
        assessment as for claim 1 and 13 holds, mutatis mutandis.

        Starting with the teaching of D1, having replaced the Backup Data Store (120)
        of FIG. 1A in D1 with the backup cluster disclosed in D2 or D3, D1 discloses in
        column 6, lines 59-67 that " the HA agent 140 on the primary machine 125

6.5     See also D1, column 10, lines 41-44.
6.6
6.6.1   Concerning replication: a widely known alternative technique to the backup
        technique. Hinted in D1, column 3, lines 19-23 : "..may be a replicated data
6.7     store of which multiple nodes have a copy" .

        See also D3, paragraph [0005]: "For distributed storage systems, a storage
        replication relationship is often established between two clusters, that is, the
        data on the primary cluster is copied to the backup cluster through a replication
        link".

        Claim 3: corresponding comments as for claim 2, i) hold. Snapshot-based
        backups are comprised in the common technical knowledge of the skilled
        person.

        Claim 4: i) data synchronization; ii) merely copying (some) data to the backup
        (cluster/storage).

        Oh i): see D3, paragraph [0027]: such as data synchronization, ...data
        synchronization between clusters .. according to pre-set rules".

        It is noted that in D1, see e.g. FIG. 3, (315), a pre-set rule is explained as a data
        protection policy for highly available data (only).

        On ii): Trivial to apply the backing up of highly available data as disclosed in D1
        to highly available user data.

        Claim 5: user (administrator) provides the backup policy determining the
        selected (highly available data in D1). See D1, column 1, lines 24-40.

        Claim 6: providing a second/further backup policy determining data to be
        backed up at another/second moment (point-in-time snapshot)..

        See D2, column 6, lines 31 -34: " For example, one cloud backup policy could
        backup a different set of data than a second cloud backup policy.". See FIG. 3
        in D2 specifying a time and a mod(ification) time for a policy 1 or 2. Taking a
        snapshot is based on a specified point-in-time.

        Claim 7: trivial; data sets are produced and stored by services (as thought in
        D3) or components or the like. Merely a system design aspect.

6.8 Claim 8, 9: control device, by two dedicated primary and secondary clients,
          detects status (failure) information concerning the primary respectively backup
           cluster.

6.8.1  Notwithstanding the Article 84 EPC objection as raised above D3 teaches in
       paragraph [0034] that the status of the main cluster can be monitored in real
       time; D3 continues to teach in paragraph [0035] that the status of the primary
       and the backup cluster can be detected in various ways. Providing the status
       monitoring/detection in two dedicated clients is again merely a system design
       aspect which the skilled person would implement in one way or the other
       without the need to apply inventive skills.

       D3 also teaches in paragraph [0041] that the system configuration can be
       changed when the main cluster fails, by switching to an available backup cluster
       (which becomes the new main cluster); see paragraph [0055]: "It is
       understandable that after switching to the backup cluster, the backup cluster
       can be used as the new primary cluster, and after the failed primary cluster is
       restored, it can be used as the backup cluster of the new primary cluster. "

       Concerning attaching additionally (primary, secondary) identity information to
       status notification does not require inventive skills; disclosed in D6, paragraph
       [0122],[0123].

6.9 Claim 10: control device isolated from the primary cluster: see D1, Backup
           Server (115) outside high availability cluster (105) in FIG. 1A. See D3, FIG. 1
           (1011) is isolated from the primary and backup cluster (1012), (1013)

7.5.4  applies to both the preamble and characterising portion (see the Guidelines, F-
7.5.5  IV, 4.19).
7.5.6
7.6    The description should be amended where appropriate to fulfil the following
       requirements:

       - To meet the requirements of Rule 42(1) (b) EPC, the documents D1 - D6
       should be identified in the description and the relevant background art disclosed
       therein should be briefly discussed.

       - The summary of the invention (Rule 42(1)(c) EPC; Guidelines F-||.4.5) must
       correspond to the amended set of claims. Where appropriate, statements such
       as "The invention is set out in the appended set of claims" or "The invention is
       as defined in claim X" may be used instead of repeating the claims verbatim.

       - Embodiments which are no longer covered by the claims must be deleted,
       unless they can reasonably be considered to be useful for highlighting specific
       aspects of the amended subject-matter. If this is the case, they must be clearly
       marked as not being part of the present invention (T 1808/06 and Guidelines F-
       IV, 4.3).

       - Any combinations of features which do not fall under the scope of the
       amended independent claims must be clearly marked as not being part of the
       present invention.

       - Statements such as "The following examples/aspects/embodiments X, Y, Z
       are not according to the invention and are present for illustration purposes only"
       may be used at the start of the description or in the list of figures.

       - The technical features of the independent claims may not be presented as
       optional in the description. Where they precede a feature of an independent

          application with the requirements of Article 123 (2) EPC, the applicant is
           requested to clearly identify the amendments carried out, irrespective of
           whether they concern amendments by addition, replacement or deletion, and to
           indicate the passages of the application as filed on which these amendments
           are based.
