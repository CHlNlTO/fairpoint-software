    vice (400, 1000) comprising a touch-sensitive display (408, 1014), com-

    prising:

    detecting (308, 908) contact with the touch-sensitive display (408, 1014)

    while the device is in a user-interface lock state;

    transitioning (314, 914) the device (400, 1000) to a user-interface unlock

    state if the detected contact corresponds to a predefined gesture; and

    maintaining (312, 912) the device (400, 1000) in the user-interface lock

    state if the detected contact does not correspond to the predefined gesture;

    characterized by

    moving an unlock image (402, 1002, 1008) along a predefined displayed

15  path on the touch-sensitive display (408, 1014) in accordance with the con--

    tact, wherein the unlock image (402, 1002, 1008) is a graphical, interac-

    tive user-interface object with which a user interacts in order to unlock the

    device (400, 1000).

    The computer-implemented method of claim 1, further comprising dis-
    playing (304) the unlock image (402) and one or more visual cues on the
    touch-sensitive display (408) while the portable electronic device (400) is
    in a user-interface lock state, wherein the one or more visual cues indicate
    a movement of the unlock image (402) along the touch-sensitive display
    (408) that will unlock the device (400).
