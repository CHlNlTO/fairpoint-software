2. FURTHER ACTION

       If a demand for international preliminary examination is made, this opinion will usually be considered to be a
       written opinion of the International Preliminary Examining Authority ("IPEA") except that this does not apply where
       the applicant chooses an Authority other than this one to be the IPEA and the chosen IPEA has notifed the
       International Bureau under Rule 66.1bis(b) that written opinions of this International Searching Authority

        will not be so considered.

       If this opinion is, as provided above, considered to be a written opinion of the IPEA, the applicant is invited to
       submit to the IPEA a written reply together, where appropriate, with amendments, before the expiration of 3 months
       from the date of mailing of Form PCTASA/220 or before the expiration of 22 months from the priority date,
       whichever expires later.

   1. With regard to the language, this opinion has been established on the basis of:

           the international application in the language in which it was filed
            a translation of the international application into , which is the language of a translation furnished for the
            purposes of international search (Rules 12.3(a) and 23.1 (b)).

                 filed together with the international application in electronic form.
                 furnished subsequently to this Authority for the purposes of search.

   3.    In addition, in the case that   more than one version or copy of a sequence listing and/or table relating thereto
         has been filed or furnished,    the required statements that the information in the subsequent or additional

 2. INDEPENDENT CLAIM 1

 2.1 The present application does not meet the criteria of Article 33(1) PCT, because the
        subject-matter of claim 1 does not involve an inventive step in the sense of Article
        33(3)PCT.

 2.2 Document D1, considered to represent the most relevant state of the art to the
        subject-matter of claim 1, discloses (the references in parentheses applying to this
        document): a method of controlling an electronic device with a touch-sensitive display
        (abstract), comprising: detecting contact with the touch-sensitive display while the
        device is in a user-interface lock state (figure 2, and abstract); detecting a plurality
        of separate or gliding touches in a predetermined order corresponding to a
        user-interface unlocking procedure ("if certain ... touch", page 4, lines 25-36);
        transitioning the device to the user-interface unlock state if the detected contact
        corresponds to a predefined gesture ("if ... deactivated", page 8, lines 4-6); and
        maintaining the device in the user-interface lock state if the detected contact does not
        correspond to the predefined gesture (figure 2, and "if it is detected ... deactivated",
        page 8, lines 7-21).

AUTHORITY (SEPARATE SHEET)

2.3 The subject-matter of independent claim 1 differs from the disclosure of D1 in that
      controlling an electronic device is accomplished by moving an image
      corresponding to a user-interface unlock state of the device in accordance with
      the (detected) contact.

2.4 The problem to be solved by the present invention may therefore be regarded as
      providing a device control method with visual feedback.

2.5 When confronted with the above problem the person skilled in the art would seek
      teaching on how such a device control method may be enacted. Within the prior art of
      such systems he/she would find document (D2) and realise that a device control
      method achieved by dragging and dropping code icons, selected by touch input, as
      shown in D2 ("access ... means", column 2, lines 20-30), would be the most effective

        solution.

3. INDEPENDENT CLAIMS 4, 7 AND 11

3.1 The present application does not meet the criteria of Article 33(1) PCT, because the
      subject-matter of claims 4, 7 and 11 does not involve an inventive step in the sense
      of Article 33(3)PCT.

3.2 Document D2 also discloses the additional features of claim 4, with respect to claim 1
       (the references in parentheses applying to this document): a method comprising:
      transitioning ... if ... corresponds to moving the image to a predefined location on the
      touch-sensitive display ("code ... icons", column 2, lines 28-34, and "the act of
      dragging ... filled", column 7, lines 51-56).

3.3 Document D2 also discloses the additional features of claim 7, with respect to claim
       1: a method comprising: transitioning ... if ... corresponds to moving the image on the
      touch-sensitive display according to a predefined path on the touch-sensitive display
       ("further ... position", column 2, lines 56-58).

       The skilled person would understand that a plurality of dragging and dropping
      operations constitutes a predefined path in this context.

AUTHORITY (SEPARATE SHEET)

3.4 Document D2 also discloses the additional features of claim 11, with respect to claim
      1: a method comprising: touch-sensitive display while the device is in a
      user-interface lock state; transitioning the device to a first active state corresponding
      to the first image if the detected contact corresponds to a predefined gesture with
      respect to the first image; and transitioning the device to a second active state distinct
      from the first active state if the detected contact corresponds to a predefined gesture
      with respect to the second image ("selecting two or more icons ... iconic password
      sequence", column 2, lines 23-24, and "access ... functions", column 2, lines 20-21).

4. INDEPENDENT CLAIMS 12-23

4.1 The present application does not meet the criteria of Article 33(1) PCT, because the
       subject-matter of claims 12-23 does not involve an inventive step in the sense of
       Article 33(3) PCT.

4.2 The same reasoning as stated with respect to claims 1, 4, 7 and 11 applies, mutatis
       mutandis, to the subject-matter of the corresponding independent claims 12-23,

       which therefore is also considered not inventive.

5. DEPENDENT CLAIMS 2, 3, 5, 6 AND 8-10

       Dependent claims 2, 3, 5, 6 and 8-10 do not contain any features which, in
       combination with the features of any claim to which they refer, meet the requirements
       of the PCT in respect of inventive step (Article 33(3) PCT), see the document(s) and
       the corresponding passages cited in the search report.
