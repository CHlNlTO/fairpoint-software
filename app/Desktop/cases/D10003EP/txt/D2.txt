ABSTRACT

Computer users access and/or execute a Selected restricted function on a computer using a graphical user interface (GUI) by entering an iconic password that is defined by Selecting two or more visual icons, called code icons, in a Sequence called an iconic password Sequence. The entered
Sequence is compared tO a target Sequence that represents the
restricted function. If the entered Sequence matches the target Sequence, the user is permitted to execute/access the restricted function. The number of possible combinations in the target Sequence, and therefore System Security, can be increased by inputting both a code icon and a target Site for
one or more of the components of the target Sequence.
