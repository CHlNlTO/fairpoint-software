            Unlocking a Device by Performing Gestures on an Unlock Image

                               RELATED APPLICATIONS

    [0001]        This application is related to US. Patent Application No. l 1/322,550, titled

    "Indication of Progress Towards Satisfaction of a User Input Condition," filed December 23,

    2005, which application is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.

                               TECHNICAL FlELD

    [0002]        The disclosed embodiments relate generally to user interfaces that employ

    touch--sensitive displays, and more particularly, to the unlocking of user interfaces on portable

    electronic devices.

10                             BAC KGROUND

    [0003]        Touch-sensitive displays (also known as "touch screens" or "touchscreens")

    are well known in the art. Touch screens are used in many electronic devices to display

    graphics and text, and to provide a user interface through which a user may interact with the

    devices. A touch screen detects and responds to contact on the touch screen. A device may

15  display one or more sofi keys, menus, and other user--interface objects on the touch screen. A

    user may interact with the device by contacting the touch screen at locations corresponding to

    the user--interface objects with which she wishes to interact.

    [0004]        Touch screens are becoming more popular for use as displays and as user

    input devices on portable devices, such as mobile telephones and personal digital assistants

20  (PDAs). One problem associated with using touch screens on portable devices is the

    unintentional activation or deactivation of functions due to unintentional contact with the

    touch screen. Thus, portable devices, touch screens on such devices, and/or applications

    running on such devices may be locked upon satisfaction of predefined lock conditions, such

    as upon entering an active call, after a predetermined time of idleness has elapsed, or upon

25  manual locking by a user.

    [0005]        Devices with touch screens and/or applications running on such devices may

    be unlocked by any of several well-known unlocking procedures, such as pressing a

    predefined set of buttons (simultaneously or sequentially) or entering a code or password.

    These unlock procedures, however, have drawbacks. The button combinations may be hard

30  to perform. Creating, memorizing, and recalling passwords, codes, and the like can be quite

                               l

                                                                                       flfififififitfih?

    P3925W01

    burdensome. These drawbacks may reduce the ease of use of the unlocking process and, as a

    consequence, the ease of use of the device in general.

    [0006]  Accordingly, there is a need for more efficient, user-friendly procedures for

    unlocking such devices, touch screens, and/or applications. More generally, there is a need

    for more efficient, user-friendly procedures for transitioning such devices, touch screens,

    and/or applications bctwccn user interface states (c.g., from a user interface state for a first

    application to a user interface state for a second application, between user interface states in

    the same application, or between locked and unlocked states). In addition, there is a need for

    sensory feedback to the user regarding progress towards satisfaction of a user input condition

10  that is required for the transition to occur.

                                           SUMMARY

10  [0031]   The audio circuitry 114, the speaker 116, and the microphone 118 provide an

    audio interface between a user and the device 100. The audio circuitry 1 14 receives audio

    data from the peripherals interface 108, converts the audio data to an electrical signal, and

    transmits the electrical signal to the speaker 116. The speaker converts the electrical signal to

    human-audible sound waves. The audio circuitry 1 14 also receives electrical signals

15  converted by the microphone 116 from sound waves. The audio circuitry 114 converts the

    electrical signal to audio data and transmits the audio data to the peripherals interface 108 for

    processing. Audio data may be may be retrieved from and/or transmitted to the memory 102

    and/or the RF circuitry 112 by the peripherals interface 108. In some embodiments, the audio

    circuitry 114 also includes a headset j ack (not shown). The headset j ack provides an interface

20  between the audio circuitry 114 and removable audio input/output peripherals, such as

    output-only headphones or a headset with both output (headphone for one or both ears) and

    input (microphone).

    [0032]   The U0 subsystem 120 provides the interface between input/output

    peripherals on the device 100, such as the touch screen 126 and other input/control devices

25  128, and the peripherals interface 108. The 1/0 subsystem 120 includes a touch-screen

    controller 122 and. one or more input controllers 124 for other input or control devices. The

    one or more input controllers 124 receive/send electrical signals from/to other input or

    control devices 128. The other input/control devices 128 may include physical buttons (e.g.,

    push buttons, rocker buttons, etc.), dials, slider switches, sticks, and so forth.

30  [003 3]  The touch screen 126 provides both an output interface and an input interface

    between the device and a user. The touch--screen controller 122 receives/sends electrical

    signals From/to the touch screen 126. The touch screen 126 displays visual output to the user.

    The visual output may include text, graphics, video, and any combination thereof. Some or
                                                                   6

    all of the visual output may correspond to user-interface objects, further details of which are

    described below.

    [0034]  The touch screen 126 also accepts input from the user based on haptic and/or

    tactile contact. The touch screen 126 forms a touch-sensitive surface that accepts user input.

    The touch screen 126 and the touch screen controller 122 (along with any associated modules

    and/or sets of instructions in the memory 102) detects contact (and any movement or break of

    the contact) on the touch screen 126 and converts the detected contact into interaction with

    user--interface objects, such as one or more soft keys, that are displayed on the touch screen.

    In an exemplary embodiment, a point of contact between the touch screen 126 and the user

10  corresponds to one or more digits of the user. The touch screen 126 may use LCD (liquid

    crystal display) technology, or LPD (light emitting polymer display) technology, although

    other display technologies may be used in other embodiments. The touch screen 126 and

    touch screen controller 122 may detect contact and any movement or break thereof using any

    of a plurality of touch sensitivity technologies, including but not limited to capacitive,

15  resistive, infrared, and surface acoustic wave technologies, as well as other proximity sensor

    arrays or other elements for determining one or more points of contact with the touch screen

    126. The touch--sensitive display may be analogous to the multi-touch sensitive tablets

    described in the following US. Patents: 6,323,846 (Westerman et al.), 6,570,557 (Westerman

    et al.), and/or 6,677,932 (Westerman), and/or US. Patent Publication 2002/0015024A1, each

20  of which is hereby incorporated by reference. However, the touch screen 126 displays visual

    output from the portable device, whereas touch sensitive tablets do not provide Visual output.

    The touch screen 126 may have a resolution in excess of 100 dpi. In an exemplary

    embodiment, the touch screen 126 may have a resolution of approximately 168 dpi. The user
    may make contact with the touch screen 126 using any suitable object or appendage, such as

25  a stylus, finger, and so forth.

    [0035]  In some embodiments, in addition to the touch screen, the device 100 may

    include a touchpad (not shown) for activating or deactivating particular functions. In some

    embodiments, the touchpad is a touch--sensitive area of the device that, unlike the touch

    screen, does not display Visual output. The touchpad may be a touch-sensitive surface that is

30  separate from the touch screen 126 or an extension of the touch-sensitive surface formed by

    the touch screen 126.

    [0036]  The device 100 also includes a power system 130 for powering the various

    components. The power system 130 may include a power management system, one or more
                                                                   7

    components and/or drivers for controlling and managing general system tasks (e.g., memory

    management, storage device control, power management, etc .) and facilitates communication

    between various hardware and sofiware components.

    [0039]  The communication module 134 facilitates communication with other devices

15  over one or more external ports 148 and also includes various software components For

    handling data received by the RF circuitry 112 and/or the external port 148. The external

    port 148 (e.g., Universal Serial Bus (USB), FIREWIRE, etc.) is adapted for coupling directly

    to other devices or indirectly over a network (e.g., the Internet, wireless LAN, etc.).

    [0040]  The contact/motion module 138 detects contact with the touch screen 126, in

20  conjunction with the touch-screen controller 122. The contact/motion module 138 includes

    various software components for performing various operations related to detection of

    contact with the touch screen 122, such as determining if contact has occurred, determining if

    there is movement of the contact and tracking the movement across the touch screen, and

    determining if the contact has been broken (i.e., if the contact has ceased). Determining

25  movement of the point of contact may include determining spccd (magnitude), velocity

    (magnitude and direction), and/or an acceleration (including magnitude and/or direction) of

    the point of contact. In some embodiments, the contact/motion module 126 and the touch

    screen controller 122 also detects contact on the touchpad.

25  the device 100 may include one or more optional optical sensors (not shown), such as CMOS

    or CCD image sensors, for use in imaging applications.

    [0046]  In some embodiments, the device 100 is a device where operation of a

    predefined set of fimctions on the device is performed exclusively through the touch screen

    126 and, if included on the device 100, the touchpad. By using the touch screen and

30  touchpad as the primary input/control device for operation of the device 100, the number of

    physical input/control devices (such as push buttons, dials, and the like) on the device 100

    may be reduced. In one embodiment, the device 100 includes the touch screen 126, the

                      9

                                                                                            11111111111%111%%%§1

        touchpad, a push button for powering the device on/off and locking the device, a volume
        adjustment rocker button and a slider switch for toggling ringer profiles. The push button
        may be used to turn the power on/ofi` on the device by depressing the button and holding the
        button in the depressed state for a predefined time interval, or may be used to lock the device
        by depressing the button and releasing the button before the predefined time interval has
        elapsed. In an alternative embodiment, the device 100 also may accept verbal input for
        activation or deactivation of some functions through the microphone 118.

        [0047]  The predefined set of functions that are performed exclusively through the

        touch screen and the touchpad include navigation between user interfaces. In some

    10  embodiments, the touchpad, when touched by the user, navigates the device 100 to a main,

        home, or root menu From any user interface that may be displayed on the device 100. In such

        embodiments, the touchpad may be referred to as a "menu button." In some other

        embodiments, the menu button may be a physical push button or other physical input/control

        device instead of a touchpad.

    15                                 User Interface States

        [0048]  The device 100 may have a plurality of user interface states. A user interface

        state is a state in which the device 100 responds in a predefined manner to user input. In

        some embodiments, the plurality of user interface states includes a user-interface lock state

        and a user-interface unlock state. In some embodiments, the plurality of user interface states

    20  includes states for a plurality of applications.

        [0049]  In the user-interface lock state (hereinafier the "lock state"), the device 100 is

        powered on and operational but ignores most, if not all, user input. That is, the device 100

        takes no action in response to user input and/or the device 100 is prevented from performing

        a predefined set of operations in response to the user input. The predefined set of operations

    25  may include navigation between user interfaces and activation or deactivation of a predefined

        set of functions. The lock state may be used to prevent unintentional or unauthorized use of

        the device 100 or activation or deactivation of functions on the device 100. When the device

        100 is in the lock state, the device 100 may be said. to be locked. In some embodiments, the

        device 100 in the lock state may respond to a limited set of user inputs, including inp ut that

    30  corresponds to an attempt to transition the device 100 to the user-interface unlock state or

        input that corresponds to powering the device 100 off. In other words, the locked device 100

        responds to user input corresponding to attempts to transition the device 100 to the user-

                                                          10

        interface unlock state or powering the device 100 off, but does not respond to user input
        corresponding to attempts to navigate between user interfaces. It should be appreciated that

        even if the device 100 ignores a user input, the device 100 may still provide sensory feedback

        (such as visual, audio, or vibration feedback) to the user upon detection of the input to

        indicate that the input will be ignored.

        [0050]  In embodiments where the device 100 includes the touch screen 126, while the

        device 100 is locked, a predefined set of operations, such as navigation between user

        interfaces, is prevented from being performed in response to contact on the touch screen 126

        when the device 100 is locked. In other words, when the contact is being ignored by the

    10  locked device 100, the touch screen may be said to be locked. A locked device 100,

        however, may still respond to a limited class of contact on the touch screen 126. The limited

        class includes contact that is determined by the device 100 to correspond to an attempt to

        transition the device 100 to the user-interface unlock state.

        [0051]  In the user-interface unlock state (hereinafter the "unlock state"), the device

    15  100 is in its normal operating state, detecting and responding to user input corresponding to

        interaction with the user interface. A device 100 that is in the unlock state may be described

        as an unlocked device 100. An unlocked device 100 detects and responds to user input For

        navigating between user interfaces, entry of data and activation or deactivation of functions.

        In embodiments where the device 100 includes the touch screen 126, the unlocked device 100

    20  detects and responds to contact corresponding to navigation between user interfaces, entry of

        data and activation or deactivation of functions through the touch scrccn 126.

                Unlocking a Device via Gestures

        [0052]  Figure 2 is a flow diagram illustrating a process 200 for transitioning a device

        to a user-interface unlock state, according to some embodiments of the invention. As used

    25  herein, transitioning from one state to another refers to the process of going from one state to

        another. The process may be, as perceived by the user, instantaneous, near--instantaneous,

        gradual or at any suitable rate. The progression of the process may be controlled

        automatically by the device, such as the device 100 (Figure 1), independent of the user, once

        the process is activated; or it may be controlled by the user. While the process flow 200

    30  described below includes a number of operations that appear to occur in a specific order, it

        should be apparent that these processes may include more or fewer operations, which may be

                11

11                                                                                          iifliflmfitfil

        executed serially or in parallel (e.g., using parallel processors or a multi-threading

        environment).

        [005 3]  A device is set to the lock state (202). The device may be set (that is,

        transition completely to the lock state from any other state) to the locked state upon

        satisfaction of any of one or more lock conditions. The lock conditions may include events

        such as the eIapsing of a predefined time of inactivity, entry into an active call, or powering

        on the device. The lock conditions may also include user intervention, namely the user

        locking the device by a predefined user input. In some embodiments, the user may be

        allowed to specify the events that serve as lock conditions. For example, the user may

    10  configure the device to transition to the lock state upon the elapsing of a predefined time of

        inactivity but not upon powering on the device.

        [0054]   In some embodiments, the locked device displays on the touch screen one or

        more visual cues of an unlock action that the user may perform to unlock the device (204).

        The visual cue(s) provide hints or reminders of the unlock action to the user. The visual cues

    15  may be textual, graphical or any combination thereof. In some embodiments, the visual cues

        are displayed upon particular events occurring while the device is locked. The particular

        events that trigger display of the visual cues may include an incoming call, incoming

        message, or some other event that may require the user's attention. In some embodiments,

        the visual cues may also be displayed upon particular user inputs, such as the user interacting

    20  with the menu button, the user making contact with the locked touch screen and/or the user

        interacting with any other input/control device. The locked device, when not displaying the

        Visual cues, may power down the touch screen (which helps to conserve power) or diSplay

        other objects on the touch screen, such as a screen saver or information that may be of

        interest to the user (e.g., battery charge remaining, date and time, network strength, etc.).

    25  [0055]   The unlock action includes contact with the touch screen. In some

        embodiments, the unlock action is a predefined gesture performed on the touch screen. As

        used herein, a gesture is a motion of the object/appcndage making contact with the touch

        screen. For example, the predefined gesture may include a contact of the touch screen on the

        left edge (to initialize the gesture), a horizontal movement of the point of contact to the

    30  opposite edge while maintaining continuous contact with the touch screen, and a breaking of

        the contact at the opposite edge (to complete the gesture).

        P3925W01

        [0056]        While the touch screen is locked, the user may initiate contact with the touch

        screen, i.e., touch the touch screen (206). For convenience of explanation, contact on the

        touch screen in the process 200 and in other embodiments described below will be described

        as performed by the user using at least one hand using one or more fingers. However, it

        should be appreciated that the contact may be made using any suitable object or appendage,

        such as a stylus, finger, etc. The contact may include one or more taps on the touch screen,

        maintaining continuous contact with the touch screen, movement of the point of contact while

        maintaining continuous contact, a breaking of the contact, or any combination thereof.

        [0057]        The device detects the contact on the touch screen (208). If the contact does

    10  not correspond to an attempt to perform the unlock action, or if the contact corresponds to a

        Failed or aborted attempt by the user to perform the unlock action (210 -- no), then the device

        remains locked (212). For example, if the unlock action is a horizontal movement of the

        point of contact across the touch screen while maintaining continuous contact with the touch

        screen, and the detected contact is a series of random taps on the touch screen, then the

    15  device will remain locked because the contact does not correspond to the unlock action.

        [0058]        If the contact corresponds to a successful performance of the unlock action,

        i.e., the user performed the unlock action successfiilly (210 -- yes), the device transitions to

        the unlock state (214). For example, if the unlock action is a horizontal movement of the

        point of contact across the touch screen while maintaining continuous contact with the touch

    20  screen, and the detected contact is the horizontal movement with the continuous contact, then

        the device transitions to the unlock state.

        [0059]        In some embodiments, the device begins the process of transitioning to the

        unlock state upon detection of any contact on the touch screen and aborts the transition as

        soon as the device determines that the contact does not correspond to an unlock action or is a

    25  failed/aborted unlock action. For example, if the unlock action is a predefined gesture, the

        device may begin the process of transitioning to the unlock state as soon as it detects the

        initial contact of the gesture and continues the progression of the transition as the gesture is

        performed. If the user aborts the gesture before it is completed, the device aborts the

        transition and remains in the lock state. If the gesture is completed, the device completes the

    30  transition to the unlock state and becomes unlocked. As another example, if the unlock

        action is a horizontal movement of the point of contact across the touch screen while

        maintaining continuous contact with the touch screen, and the user taps the touch screen

        once, the device begins the process of the state transition as soon as it detects the tap but also
                                                                      13

        P392 5W0]

        aborts the process soon after because it realizes that the tap is just a tap and does not

        correspond to the unlock action.

        [0060]  While the device is unlocked, the device may display on the touch screen user-

        interface objects corresponding to one or more functions of the device and/or information that

        may be of interest to the user. The user--interface objects are objects that make up the user

        interface of the device and may include, without limitation, text, images, icons, sofi keys (or

        "virtual buttons"), pull-down menus, radio buttons, check boxes, selectable lists, and so forth.

        The displayed user--interface objects may include non-interactive objects that convey

        information or contribute to the look and feel of the user interface, interactive objects with

    10  which the user may interact, or any combination thereof. The user may interact with the user-

        interface objects by makin g contact with the touch screen at one or more touch screen

        locations corresponding to the interactive obj ects with which she wishes to interact. The

        device detects the contact and responds to the detected contact by performing the operation(s)

        corresponding to the interaction with the interactive object(s).

    15  [0061]  While the device is locked, the user may still make contact on the touch

        screen. However, the locked device is prevented from performing a predefined set of actions

        in response to any detected contact until the device is unlocked. The prevented predefined set

        of action may include navigating between user interfaces and entry of data by the user.

        [0062]  While the device is locked, the device may display'one or more visual cues of

20      the unlock action, as described above. In some embodiments, the device may also display,

        along with the Visual cues, an unlock image. The unlock image is a graphical, interactive

        user-interface object with which the user interacts in order to unlock the device. In other

        words, the unlock action is pcrformcd with respect to the unlock image. In some

        embodiments, performing the unlock action with respect to the image includes dragging the

25      unlock image in a predefined manner, which moves the unlock image across the touch screen.

        In some embodiments, if the unlock action is not completed, the GUI display can show

        rcvcrsc progress towards the locked state by gradually returning the unlock image to its

        position in the locked state

        [0063]  In some embodiments, in addition to visual feedback, the electronic device

    30  supplies non--visual feedback to indicate progress towards completion of the unlock action. In

        some embodiments, in addition to visual feedback, the electronic device supplies non-visual

        feedback to indicate completion of the unlock action. The additional feedback may include

        audible feedback (e.g., sound(s)) or physical feedback (e.g., vibration(s)).

        [0064]        Figure 3 is a flow diagram illustrating a process 300 for transitioning a device

        to a user-interface unlock state using an unlock image, according to some embodiments of the

        invention. The process 300 is similar to the process 200 (Figure 2) with the addition of an

        unlock image that is displayed with the visual cues. Thc unlock action in the process 300 is
        performed with respect to the unlock image, i.e., the unlock action includes interaction with

        the unlock image. While the process flow 300 described below includes a number of

        operations that appear to occur in a specific order, it should be apparent that these processes

    10  can include more or fewer operations, which can be executed serially or in parallel (e.g.,

        using parallel processors or a multi-threading environment).

        [0065]        The device is locked upon satisfaction of a lock condition (302), similar to the

        operation 202 (Figure 2). An unlock image and Visual cues oFthe unlock action using the
        unlock image are displayed (304). The operation 304 is the same as the operation 204

    15  (Figure 2), except that in the operation 304 an unlock image is displayed in addition to the

        visual cues.

        [0066]        As described above, the unlock action includes interaction with the unlock

        image. In some embodiments, the unlock action includes the user performing a predefined

        gesture with respect to the unlock image. In some embodiments, the gesture includes

    2O  dragging the unlock image to a location on the touch screen that meets one or more

        predefined unlock criteria. In other words, the user makes contact with the touch screen at a

        location corresponding to the unlock image and then performs the predefined gesture while

        maintaining continuous contact with the touch screen, dragging the image to the location that

        meets the predefined unlock criteria. In some embodiments, the unlock action is completed

    25  by breaking the contact with the touch screen (thus releasing the unlock image) upon

        completion of the predefined gesture.

        [0067]        A location meeting one or more predefined unlock criteria is simply a location

        on the touch screen that is predefined as a location to which the unlock image is to be

        dragged in order to unlock the device. The location(s) may be defined narrowly or broadly

    30  and may be one or more particular locations on the touch screen, one or more regions on the

        touch screen, or any combination thereof. For example, the location may be defined as a

                                               15

15                                                                                          IIIMWMIW

        particular marked location, areas at each of the four corners of the touch screen, or a quadrant

        of the touch screen, etc.

        [0068]  In some embodiments, the interaction includes dragging the unlock image to a

        predefined location on the touch screen. For example, the unlock action may include

        dragging the unlock image from one corner of the touch screen to another comer of the touch

        screen. As another example, the unlock action may include dragging the unlock image fiom
        one edge of the touch screen to the opposite edge. The emphasis here is on the final

        destination of the unlock image (and of the finger). Thus, the user can drag the unlock image

        from its initial location along any desired path. As long as the unlock image reaches the

    10  predefined location and is released at that location, the device is unlocked. It should be

        appreciated that the predefined location may be, as described above, defined narrowly or

        broadly and may be one or more particular locations on the touch screen, one or more regions

        on the touch screen, or any combination thereof.

        [0069]  In some other embodiments, the unlock action includes dragging the unlock

    15  image along a predefined path. For example, the unlock action may include dragging the

        unlock image clockwise along the perimeter of the touch screen (the path being the perimeter

        of the touch screen), From one of the corners and back. As another example, the unlock

        action may include dragging the unlock image from one edge of the touch screen to the

        opposite edge in a linear path. The emphasis here is on the path along which the unlock

    20  image (and the finger) moves. Because of the emphasis on the path, the final location to

        which the unlock image is to be moved may be defined broadly. For example, the unlock

        action may be to drag the unlock image from its initial location, along the predefined path, to

        any spot within a predefined region on the touch screen. The predefined path may include one

        or more straight lines or lines with twists and turns.

    25  [0070]  The user makes contact with the touch screen (306), similar to the operation

        206 (Figure 2). The device detects the contact with the touch screen (308), similar to the

        operation 208 (Figure 2). If the contact docs not correspond to successful performance of the

        unlock action with respect to the image (310 -- no), the device remains locked. If the contact

        does correspond to successful performance of the unlock action with respect to the image

    3O  (310 -- yes), the device is unlocked (314).

        [0071]  Figures 4A -- 4B illustrate the GUI display of a device in a user-interface lock

        touch screen 408 and a menu button 410. The device 400 is locked and the touch screen 408

        is displaying an unlock image 402 and visual cues. The visual cues shown include a channel

        404 indicating the path of the gesture/movernent along which the unlock image 402 is to be

        dragged, similar to a groove along which a slider switch moves; and one or more arrows 406

        indicating the direction of the gesture/movement. The end of the channel 404 (in Figures 4A

        -- 4B and 5A -- 5D, the "end" of the channel is the right end) also serves as a predefined

        location to which the unlock image 402 is to be dragged. The unlock image 402 may also

        include an arrow to further remind the user the direction of the gesture/movement. As

        described above, the visual cues and the unlock image may be displayed. by the device 400

    10  upon an event that may require the user's attention (e.g., incoming call or message) or upon

        user intervention (e.g., the user pressing the menu button 410 while the device is locked).

        [0072]  In some embodiments, the arrows 406 and the arrow on the unlock image 402

        may be animated. For example, the arrow on the unlock image 402 may appear and

        disappear in a pulse-like manner and the arrows 406 may emanate from one end of the

    15  channel 406 in sync with the pulsing of the arrow on the unlock image 402. As shown in

        Figure 4B, the arrow 406 may move along the channel 404 and disappear when it moves to

        the end of the charme1404.

        [0073]  The visual cues illustrated in Figures 4A and 4B remind the user that the

        unlock action is a predefined gesture that includes a horizontal movement of the finger (and

    20  thus moving the point of contact) along the channel 404, from the beginning of the channel

        404, where the unlock image is initially located, to the end of the channel 404. It should be

        appreciated, however, that the visual cues shown in Figures 4A - 4B are merely exemplary

        and that more or fewer Visual cues, or alternative visual cues may be used. The content of the

        visual cues may be based on the particulars of the unlock action.

25      [0074]  Figures 5A -- 5D illustrate the GUI display of a device at various points of the

        performance of an unlock action gesture, according to some embodiments of the invention.

        In Figure 5A, the user, represented by the hand and finger 502 (not drawn to scale), begins

        the unlock action by touching the touch screen 408 of device 400 with her finger 502. In

        some embodiments, the touch screen 408 is initially in sleep mode and/or dark, and the

    30  screen 408 displays the unlock image 402 when touched. The user touches the touch screen

        408 at the location corresponding to the unlock image 402, which is located initially at the

        left end of the channel 404. The contact, either overlapping with the unlock image 402 or in

        proximity to the unlock image 402, is detected by the device 400 and is determined to be an
                                                                      17

        attempt to unlock the touch screen, based on the fact that the user 502 is interacting with the

        unlock image 402.

        [0075]  In Figure 5B, the user is in the process of performing the gesture by moving

        her finger, which is in continuous contact with the touch screen 408, in the direction of

        movement 504. The unlock image 402 is dragged along the channel 404 as a result of the

        gesture. The channel 404 reminds the user that the unlock gesture is a horizontal motion. In

        some embodiments, the channel 404 indicates the predefined location (in Figures 5A -- 5D,

        the tight end of the channel) to which the user drags the unlock image 402 to complete the

        unlock action and/or the predefined path along which the user drags the unlock image 402 to

    10  complete the unlock action.

        [0076]  In Figure 5C, the user has dragged the unlock image 402 to the right end of the

        channel 404. Once the user releases the unlock image 402 at the right end of the channel 404,

        the unlock action is complete. Upon completion of the unlock gesture, the device unlocks

        and displays on the touch screen 408 user-interface objects associated with normal operation

    15  of the device 400. Figure 5D illustrates an example of user--interface objects that may be

        displayed when the device 400 is unlocked. In Figure 5D, the device 400 displays a menu

        506. The menu 506 includes interactive user-interface objects correspondin g to various

        applications or operations. A user may interact with the user-interface objects to activate an

        application or perform an operation. It should be appreciated, however, that the device 400,

20      upon being unlocked, may display additional or alternative user--interface objects.

        [0077]  In some embodiments, the unlock image 402 may also be used to indicate

        failure of performance of the unlock action. For example, if the user breaks the contact with

        the touch screen before the unlock image reaches the right end of the channel 404, the unlock

        action has failed. The device 400 may display the unlock image 402 returning to its initial

25      position on the left end of the channel 404, allowing the user to attempt the unlock action

        again, if she so chooses. In some embodiments, the device goes back to sleep if no gesture is

        applied in a predetermined period of time.

        [0078]  In some embodiments, the user may unlock the device 400 by contacting the

        touch screen 408 and moving the point of contact horizontally along a fraction of the channel

30      404, i.e., the user need not move all the way to the right end of the channel. In some

        embodiments, the user may unlock the device 400 by making contact anywhere on the touch

                                                    18

        channel 404.

        [0079]        In some embodiments, the lock/unlock feature may apply to specific

        applications that are executing on the device 400 as opposed to the device 400 as a whole. In

        some embodiments, an unlock gesture transitions from one application to another, for

        example, from a telephone application to a music player or vice versa. The lock/unlock

        feature may include a hold or pause feature. In some embodiments, as the user transitions

        from a first application and to a second application, a user interface for the second application

        may fade in (i.e., increase in intensity) and a user interface for the first application may fade

    10  out (i.e., decrease in intensity). The fade in and fade out may occur smoothly over a pre--

        determined time interval, such as 0.2 s, Is or 2s. The pre-determined time interval may be in

        accordance with the unlock gesture, such as the time it takes the user to perform the gesture.

                Indication ofProgress Towards Satisfaction ofa User Input Condition

        [0080]        Figure 6 is a flow diagram illustrating a process 600 for indicating progress

    15  towards satisfaction of a user input condition according to some embodiments of the

        invention. While the process flow 600 described below includes a number of operations that

        appear to occur in a specific order, it should be apparent that these processes can include

        more or fewer operations, which can be executed serially or in parallel (e.g., using parallel

        processors or a multi-threading environment).

    20  [0081]        While an electronic device is in a first user-interface state, progress is detected

        (602) towards satisfaction of a user input condition needed to transition to a second user-

        interface state. In some embodiments, the first user-interface state is for a first application and

        the second user-interface state is for a second application. In some embodiments, the first

        user--interface state is a lock state and the second user--interface state is an unlock state.

    25  [0082]        While the device is in the first uscr-intcrfacc state, progress is indicated (604)

        towards satisfaction of the condition by transitioning an optical intensity of one or more user

        interface objects associated with the second user-interface state. The change in optical

        intensity of the user-interface objects provides a user with sensory feedback of the progress in

        transitioning between user interface states.

    30  [0083]        In some embodiments, in addition to visual feedback, the device supplies non-

        visual feedback to indicate progress towards satisfaction of the user input condition. The

        additional feedback may include audible feedback (e.g., sound(s)) or physical feedback (e.g.,

        vibration(s)).

        [0084]   The device transitions (606) to the second user-interface state if the condition

        is satisfied. In some embodiments, in addition to visual feedback, the device supplies non-

        visual feedback to indicate satisfaction of the user input condition. The additional feedback

        may include audible feedback (c.g., sound(s)) or physical feedback (c.g., vibration(s)).

        [0085]   The optical intensity of a user--interface object, as used herein, is the object's

        degree of visual materialization. The optical intensity may be measured along a scale

        between a predefined minimum and a predefined maximum. In some embodiments, the

    10  optical intensity may be measured along a logan'thrnic scale. In some embodiments, the

        optical intensity may be perceived by users as a transparency effect (or lack thereof) applied

        to the user--interface object. In some embodiments, the minimum optical intensity means that

        the object is not displayed at all (i.e., the object is not perceptible to the user), and the

        maximum optical intensity means that the object is diSplayed without any transparency effect

    15  (i.e., the object has completely materialized visually and is perceptible to the user). In some

        other embodiments, the optical intensity may be the Visual differentiation between the user-

        interface object and the background, based on color, hue, color saturation, brightness,

        contrast, transparency, and any combination thereof.

        [0086]   In some embodiments, the optical intensity of the user-interface obj ects to be

    20  displayed in the second user-interface state is increased smoothly. Smoothly may include a

        transition time that is greater than a pre-defined threshold, for example, 0.2 s, ls or 23. The

        rate of the transition of the optical intensity may be any predefined rate.

        [008 7]  In some embodiments, the indication of progress towards completion of the

        user input condition is a function of the user's satisfaction of the condition. For example, for

    25  a transition to an unlock state, the indication of progress towards completion is a function of

        the user's performance of an unlock action. For a linear fimction, the indication of progress

        is 10% complete when the unlock action is 10% complete; the indication of progress is 50%

        complete when the unlock action is 50% complete, and so forth, up to 100% completion of

        the unlock action, at which point the transition to the unlock state occurs. Correspondingly,

    30  for a linear function, the transition of the optical intensity from an initial value to a final value

        is 10% complete when the unlock action is 10% complete; the transition is 50% complete

        when the unlock action is 50% complete, and so forth, up to 100% completion of the unlock

        action, at which point the optical intensity is at its final value. In some embodiments, the user
        may perceive the optical intensity transition as a fading in of the user-interface objects as the

        unlock action is performed. It should be appreciated that the function need not be linear and

        alternative fimctions may be used, further details of which are described below, in relation to

        Figures 8A -- 8C.

        [008 8]  1f the user input condition includes a prcdcfincd gcsturc then the indication of

        progress of the gesture may be defined in terms of how much of the gesture is completed and

        how much of the gesture is remaining. For example, if the gesture includes moving the finger

        from one edge of the screen to the opposite edge horizontally, then the indication of progress

    10  may be defined in terms of the distance between the two edges because the distance

        remaining objectively measures how much Further the user has to move her finger to

        complete the gesture.

        [0089]   IF the user input condition includes dragging an image to a predefined

        location, then the indication of progress may be defined in terms of the distance between the

    15  initial location of the image and the predefined location to which the image is to be dragged

        in order to complete the input condition.

        [0090]   If the user input condition includes dragging an image along a predefined path,

        then the indication of progress may be defined in terms of the length of the predefined path.

        [0091]   Figures 7A -- 7D illustrate the GUI display of a device that is transitioning the

    20  optical intensity of user-interface objects concurrent with a transition from a first user

        interface state to a second user interface state, according to some embodiments of the

        invention. In Figure 7A, the device 700 is locked and has received an incoming call. The

        device 700 is displaying a prompt 706 to the user, informing the user of the incoming call, on

        the touch screen 714. The device is also displaying the unlock image 702 and channel 704 so

    25  that thc uscr can unlock the device 700 in order to accept or decline the incoming call. The

        user begins the unlock action by making contact on the touch screen with her finger 710 on

        the unlock image 702.

        [0092]   In Figure 7B, the user is in the process of dragging the unlock image 702

        along the channel 704 in the direction of movement 712. As the user drags the unlock image,

    30  a set of virtual buttons 708 appears and increases in optical intensity. The virtual buttons 708

        are shown with dotted outlines to indicate that they are not yet at their final optical intensity

        levels. The virtual buttons 708 are associated with the prompt 706; the virtual buttons shown

                                                   21

        in Figure 7B -- 7D allow the user to decline or accept the incoming call. However, the user
        cannot interact with the virtual buttons 708 until the device is unlocked and the virtual
        buttons have reached their final optical intensity. In Figure 7C, the user drags the unlock
        image 702 further along the channel 704 in the direction of movement 712. The virtual
        buttons 708 have increased fiirther in optical intensity relative to their optical intensity in
        Figure 73, as illustrated by their different style of dotted outlines. The increases in optical
        intensity indicate to the user progress towards completion of the unlock action.

        [0093]  In Figure 7D, the user completes the unlock action by dragging the unlock

        image to the right end of the channel 704 and releasing the unlock image 702. The device

    10  700 transitions to the unlock state. The unlock image 702 and the channel 704 disappear

        from the display and the virtual buttons 708 are at their final optical intensity levels, as

        illustrated by their solid outlines. At this point the user may interact with the virtual buttons

        708 and accept or decline the incoming call.

        [0094]  As described above in relation to Figures 5A -- 5D, if the unlock action fails

    15  because the user releases the unlock image prematurely, the unlock image may return to its

        initial location. In some embodiments, the optical intensity of the virtual buttons 708 or other

        user-interface objects that were increasing in optical intensity as the unlock action was

        performed may, concurrent with the return of the unlock image to its initial location, have

        their optical intensity decreased smoothly, back to their initial levels.

    20  [0095]  Figures 8A -- 8C are graphs illustrating optical intensity as a function of the

        completion of the user input condition, according to some embodiments of the invention. In

        Figure 8A, the optical intensity is a linear function of the completion of the user input

        condition. At 0% completion, the optical intensity is at an initial value (in this case, the

        initial value is 0). As the completion percentage increases, the optical intensity increases

    25  linearly with the completion percentage, until it reaches the final value at 100% completion.

        [0096]  In Figure 8B, the optical intensity is a nonlinear function of the completion of

        the user input condition. At 0% completion, the optical intensity is at an initial value (in this

        case, the initial value is 0). As the completion percentage increases, the optical intensity

        increases gradually at first, but the increase becomes steeper as the completion percentage

    30  increases, until it reaches the final value at 100% completion.

        [0097]  In Figure 8C, the optical intensity is another nonlinear function of the

        completion of the user input condition. At 0% completion, the optical intensity is at an initial

                                                      22

        value (in this case, the initial value is 0). As the completion percentage increases, the optical

        intensity increases steeply at first, but the increase becomes more gradual as the completion

        percentage increases, until it reaches the final value at 100% completion. In some

        embodiments, the optical intensity may increase according to a logarithmic scale.

        [0098]         In some embodiments, the optical intensity may reach its final value prior to

        100 % completion of the user input condition (c.g., at 90% completion).

                 User Interface Active States Corresponding to Events or Applications

        [0099]         Figure 9 is a flow diagram illustrating a process 900 for transitioning a device

        to a user interface active state corresponding to one of a plurality of unlock images, according

    10  to some embodiments of the invention. In some embodiments, the device may have one or

        more active applications running when the device becomes locked. Additionally, while

        locked, the device may continue to receive events, such as incoming calls, messages,

        voicemail notifications, and. so forth. The device may display multiple unlock images on the

        touch screen, each unlock image corresponding to an active application or incoming event.

    15  Performing the unlock action using one of the multiple unlock images unlocks the device and

        displays the application and/or event corresponding to the unlock image. The user interface

        active state, as used herein, means that the device is unlocked and a corresponding

        application or event is displayed on the touch screen to the user. While the process flow 900

        described below includes a number of operations that appear to occur in a specific order, it

    2O  should be apparent that these processes can include more or fewer operations, which can be

        executed serially or in parallel (e.g., using parallel processors or a multi-threading

        environment).

        [00100]        The device is looked upon satisfaction of a predefined lock condition (902).

        The device may have active applications running when it is locked and the active applications

    25  may continue running while the device is locked. Additionally, while the device is locked,

        the device may receive events, such as incoming calls, messages, and voicemail notifications.

        [00101]        The device displays a plurality of unlock images, each displayed unlock image

        corresponding to an active application running or an event received while the device is locked

        (904). In some embodiments, the device also displays visual cues of the unlock action with

    3O  respect to each unlock image. The device may display additional unlock images and visual

        cues as additional events are received. The user makes contact with the touch screen (906).

        The device detects the contact gesture (908). If the detected contact gesture does not 4

        diSplayed unlock images (e.g., because the contact is not an attempt to perform the unlock

        action or the unlock action failed/was aborted) (910 ---- no), the device remains locked (912).

        If the detected contact gesture does correspond to successful performance of the unlock

        action with respect to one of the displayed unlock images (910 -- yes), the touch screen is

        unlocked and the running application or event corresponding to the one of the unlock images

        is displayed on the touch screen (914). In other words, the device transitions to a first active

        state corresponding to the first image if the detected contact corresponds to a predefined

        gesture with respect to the first image; the device transitions to a second active state distinct

10      from the first active state and corresponding to the second image if the detected contact

        corresponds to a predefined gesture with respect to the second image; and so on.

        [00102]       The device becomes unlocked and makes the corresponding event or

        application visible to the user, active, or running in the foreground, as opposed to running in

        the background, upon performance of the unlock action with respect to the particular unlock

    15  image. The user-interface active state includes the running application or incoming event

        corresponding to the particular unlock image with which the user interacted being displayed

        prominently on the touch screen, in addition to the device being unlocked. Thus, unlocking

        using a first unlock image (if multiple unlock images are displayed) transitions the device to a

        first user-interface active state, in which the device is unlocked and the application/event

20      corresponding to the first unlock image is displayed prominently. Unlocking using a second

        image transitions the device to a second user--interface active state, in which the device is

        unlocked and the application/event corresponding to the second unlock image is displayed

        promincntly.

        [00103]       In some embodiments, the device may prioritize which unlock images to

25      diSplay. The device may display a subset of the corresponding unlock images on the touch

        screen at one time. The device may decide which subset to display based on one or more

        predefined criteria. For example, the device may display only unlock images corresponding

        to the most recent events and/or running applications. As another example, the device may

        display only unlock images corresponding to incoming events.

30      [00104]       Figure 10 illustrates the GUI of a device 1000 in a user~interface lock state

        that displays a plurality of unlock images, according to some embodiments of the invention.

        In Figure 10, the touch screen 1014 ofthe device 1000 is locked. A first unlock image 1002

        is displayed with corresponding visual cues, such as the first channel 1004 and arrow 1006.
                                                                      24

        A second unlock image 1008 is displayed with corresponding visual cues, such as the second
        channel 1010 and arrow 1012. The touch screen 1014 may display additional unlock images
        and visual cues. The first unlock image 1002 corresponds to a first running application or
        received event. The second unlock image 1008 corresponds to a second running application
        or received event. The first and second unlock images and visual cues are similar to the
        unlock image and visual cues described above, in relation to Figures 4A and 4B. The arrows
        1006 and 1012 may be animated to move from one end of the channels 1004 and/or 1010 to
        the other end, in order to indicate the proper direction of the predefined gesture or movement
        of the unlock image.

    10  [00105]  Figures 11A -- 1 IF illustrate the GUI display of a device at various points in

        the performance of an unlock action gesture corresponding to one of a plurality of unlock

        images, according to some embodiments of the invention. In Figure 11A, the user makes

        contact with the touch screen 1014 using her finger 1102 (not shown to scale), at the location

        corresponding to the second unlock image 1008. The user performs the unlock action gesture

    15  by moving the point of contact, dragging the second unlock image 1008. Figure 118 shows a

        snapshot of the device 1000 during the pendency of the unlock action. The second unlock

        image 1008 is moved along in the channel 1010 in the direction of movement 1104.

        [00106]  Figure 1 1C shows the second unlock image 1008 moved to the end of the

        channel 1010, where the unlock action with respect to the second unlock image 1008 will be

    20  completed once the user breaks the contact (and releases the second unlock image 1008). In

        some embodiments, the unlock action is completed when the unlock image 1008 is moved to

        the end of the channel 1010, With or without the user breaking contact, and the second unlock

        image 1008 disappears. As shown in Figure 11D, upon completion of the unlock action with

        respect to the second unlock image 1008, the device displays on the touch screen the user--

    25  interface objects 1 106 associated with the application or event corresponding to the second

        unlock image 1008. In Figure 11D, the event corresponding to the second unlock image is an

        incoming text message event and a prompt for the user to read it.

        [00107]  The user, instead of performing the unlock action with respect to the second

        unlock image 1108, may instead perform the unlock action gesture with respect to the first

    30  unlock image 1002. In Figure 1 1B, the user does so and performs the unlock action with

        respect to the first unlock image 1002 by dragging the first unlock image, in the direction

        1 104, to the right end ofthe channel 1004. Upon completion ofthe unlock action, the device

        1000 displays the user--interface objects 1108 associated with the application or event
                                                                      25

    corresponding to the first unlock image 1002. In Figure 11F, the application corresponding

    to the first unlock image is a music player application.

    [00108]        In some embodiments, the transition to a user interface active state, as

    descfibed in Figures 9 and 1 1A -- 11E, may also include a concurrent transition in the optical

    intensity of user--interface objects, similar to that described above in relation to Figures 6, 7A

    ---- 7D, and 8A -- 8C. Concurrent with the transition to a user interface active state, the user-

    interface objects associated with the application or event corresponding to the unlock image

    with which the user interacted to unlock the device increase in intensity. For example, the

    optical intensity of the user-interface objects 1 106 associated with the text message prompt in

10  Figure 11D may be increased smoothly, as a function of the progress towards completion of

    the unlock action with respect to the second unlock image 1008. As another example, the

    optical intensity of the user-interface objects 1 108 associated with music player application in

    Figure 11F may be increased smoothly, as a function of the progress towards completion of
    the unlock action with respect to the first unlock image 1002.
