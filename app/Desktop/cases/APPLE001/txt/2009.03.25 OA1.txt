       2.1 The amendments filed with entry into the regional phase before the EPO introduce
                subject-matter which extends beyond the content of the application as filed,
               contrary to Article 123(2) EPC.

       2.2 Claims 2, 9, 13, 15, 17 and 19 have been amended by removing the feature
              portable. This appears to have no basis in the description, as support can only be
              found for a portable electronic device. The claims should be amended to
              remedy this.

       3. Since it has been assumed that the non-oomplianoe with Article 123(2) EPC may
              be resolved in the relatively straightforward manner above, the examining division
              has been prepared to continue with other aspects of substantive examination.

       4. Claims 1, 8, 12, 14, 16 and 18 have been drafted as separate independent
              method claims. In addition, claims 2, 9, 13, 15, 17 and 19 have been drafted as
              separate independent apparatus Claims.

              Under Article 84 in combination with Rule 43(2) EPC an application may contain
               more than one independent claim in a particular category only if the subjeot-matter
              claimed falls within one or more of the exceptional situations set out in paragraphs
               (a), (b) or (o) of Rule 43(2) EPC. This is not the case in the present application,
               however, as it would be appropriate to cover the subjeot-matter, as disclosed in
              these independent claims, by a single claim (see the Guidelines, C-III, 3.2).

              The applicant should file an amended set of claims which complies with Rule
              43(2) EPC, i.e. comprising one independent claim in each category. If the
              applicant is of the opinion that more than one independent claim in any category is
              justifiable, he/she is invited to demonstrate convincingly that such claims fall under
              one of the exceptions explicitly given in this rule.

       5.1 The present application does not meet the requirements of Article 84 EPC in that
              the matter for which protection is sought is not clearly defined.

       5.2 The use of the expression at to introduce claims 1, 8, 12, 14, 16 and 18 makes it
              unclear whether protection is sought for the method only or for all the features
              defined in the claim. The claims should be amended to computer-implemented
              method of controlling an electronic device comprising a touch-sensitive
              display, comprising: (see the Guidelines, C-III, 4.15).

       6.1 The present application does not meet the requirements of Article 52(1) EPC, as
              the subjeot-matter of independent claims 1, 2, 8, 9 and 12-20 does not involve an
              inventive step in the sense of Article 56 EPC, for the following reasons:

       6.2 Document (D1) discloses the following features of independent Claim 1: a
              oomputer-implemented method of controlling an electronic device comprising
              a touch-sensitive display (abstract), comprising: detecting contact with the
              touoh-sensitive display while the device is in a user-interfaoe look state (figure 2,
              and abstract); moving said contact along a predetermined displayed path on the
              touoh-sensitive display in accordance with the contact ("control touch", page 4,
              lines 23-36, "contact outlining", page 9, lines 9-12, and "specification of
              background images images", page 10, lines 33-35); transitioning the device to a
              user-interfaoe unlock state if the detected contact corresponds to a predefined
              gesture ("if deactivated", page 8, lines 4-6); and maintaining the device in the
              user-interfaoe look state if the detected contact does not correspond to the
              predefined gesture (figure 2, and "if detected", page 8, lines 7-14).

       6.3 The subjeot-matter of independent Claim 1 differs from the disclosure of D1 in that
              the method of controlling an electronic device is accomplished by moving an
              unlock image on the touoh-sensitive display wherein the unlock image is
              a graphical, interactive user--interface object with which the user interacts in
              order to unlock the device.

       6.4 The problem to be solved by the present invention may therefore be regarded as
              providing a device control method with visual feedback.

       6.5 When confronted with the above problem the person skilled in the art would seek
              teaching on how such a device control method may be enacted. Within the prior
              art of such systems he/she would find document (D2) and realise that a device
              control method achieved by dragging and dropping oode icons, selected by touch
              input, as shown in D2 ("access icons", column 2, lines 20-34, and "the act of
              dragging position", column 7, lines 51-58), would be the most effective solution.

       6.6 The same reasoning as stated with respect to Claim 1 applies, mutatis mutandis,
              to the subjeot-matter of corresponding independent claims 2, 8, 9 and 12-20,
              which therefore does not involve an inventive step in the sense of Article 56 EPC.

       7. Dependent claims 3-7, 10 and 11 do not contain any features which, in
              combination with the features of any claim to which they refer, meet the
              requirements of the EPC in respect of inventive step (Article 56 EPC), the
              subjeot-matter therein relating to well-known equivalents, straightforward

              refinements and/or mere design choices, see the document(s) and the
              corresponding passages cited in the search report.

       8.1 Independent claims are currently not in the two part form in accordance with Rule
              43(1) EPC, which in the present case would be appropriate, with those features
              known in combination from the prior art (document D1) being placed in the
              preamble (Rule 43(1)(a) EPC) and with novel features being included in the
              characterising part (Rule 43(1)(b) EPC).

              If, however, the applicant is of the opinion that the two part form would be
              inappropriate, then reasons therefor should be provided in the letter of reply. In
              addition, the applicant should ensure that it is clear from the description which
              features of the subject-matter of claim 1 are already known in combination from
              the document D1 (see the Guidelines, C-lll, 2.3.2).

       8.2 The features of the claims should be provided with reference signs placed in
              parentheses to increase the intelligibility of the claims (Rule 43(7) EPC). This
              applies to both the preamble and characterising portion (see the Guidelines, C-lll,
              4.19).

       9.1 Although it is not apparent which part of the application could serve as a basis for
              a new, allowable claim, the applicant may nevertheless regard some particular
              matter as patentable and worthy of pursuit. Should he/she so decide, claims
              should be filed taking account of Rule 43(1) EPC and the following requirements:

       9.2 The application may not be amended in such a way that it contains subject-matter
              which extends beyond the content of the application as filed (Article 123(2) EPC).
              This also applies to previously undisclosed combinations of claimed features.

       9.3 The applicant should specify in an accompanying letter the difference between the
              independent claim and the prior art, the technical problem to be solved by said
              difference, and why the proposed solution would not be obvious to the skilled
              person.

       9.4 When filing amended claims the applicant should at the same time bring the
              description into conformity with the amended claims. Care should be taken during
              revision, especially of the introductory portion and any statements of problem or
              advantage, not to add subject-matter which extends beyond the content of the

              application as originally filed (Article 123(2) EPC).

       9.5 To meet the requirements of Rule 42(1)(b) EPC, the documents D1 and D2
              should be identified in the description and the relevant background art disclosed
              therein should be briefly discussed.

       9.6 In order to facilitate the examination of the conformity of the amended application
              with the requirements of Article 123(2) EPC, the applicant should clearly identify
              any amendments, whether by addition, replacement or deletion, and indicate the
              passages of the application as filed on which these amendments are based (see
              the Guidelines, E-II, 1).

       9.7 Any information the applicant may wish to submit concerning the subject-matter of
              the invention, for example further details of its advantages or of the problem it
              solves, and for which there is no basis in the application as filed, should be
              confined to the letter of reply and not be incorporated into the application (Article
              123(2) EPC and the Guidelines, C-VI, 5.3.4 to 5.3.8).
