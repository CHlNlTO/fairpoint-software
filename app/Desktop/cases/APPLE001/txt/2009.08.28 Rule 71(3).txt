The mention of the grant of the patent shall be published in the European Patent Bulletin as soon as possible
after the requirements concerning the translation of the Claims and the payment of the fees for grant and
printing, claims fees, designation fees and renewal fees as laid down in Rule 71 (3), (4), (6) and (8) and (9)
EPC are fulfilled.

Any divisional applications relating to this European patent application must be filed directly at the European

date on which the European Patent Bulletin mentions the grant of the patent (see Guidelines for Examination
in the EPO,A-IV,1.1.1).

procedure described in Rule 71 (4) EPC is to be followed.

If this communication is based upon an auxiliary request, and you reply within the time limit set that you
maintain the main or a higher ranking request which is not allowable, the application will be refused (Art. 97(2)
EPC).

If the enclosed Claims contain amendments proposed by the Examining Division, and you reply within the time
limit set that you cannot accept these amendments, refusal of the application under Article 97(2) EPC will
result if agreement cannot be reached on the text for grant.

Date 28.08.2009  Sheet 3  Application No.: 06 846 405.6

              In all cases except those of the previous two paragraphs, if the fees for grant and printing or Claims fees are
              not paid, or the translations are not filed, in due time, the European patent application will be deemed to be
            withdrawn (R. 71(7) EPC).

             For all payments you are requested to use EPO Form 1010 or EPO Form 1010E or to refer to the relevant
            reference number.

              After publication, the European patent specification can be downloaded free of charge from the EPO
            publication server https://publications.european-patent-officeorq or ordered from the Vienna sub-office upon
            payment of a fee (OJ EPO 2005, 126).

              Upon request in writing each proprietor will receive the certificate for the European patent together with one
              copy of the patent specification provided that the request is filed within the time limit of Rule 71 (3) EPC. If
              such request has been previously filed, it has to be confirmed within the time limit of Rule 71(3) EPC. The
              requested copy is free of charge. If the request is filed after expiry of the Rule 71(3) EPC time limit, the
              certificate will be delivered without a copy of the patent specification (R.74 EPC, Decision of the President of
            the EPO, Special edition No.3, OJ EPO 2007, D2).

            Note on payment of renewal fees

              If a renewal fee falls due between notification of the present communication and the proposed date of
              publication of the mention of the grant of the European patent, publication will be effected only after the
              renewal fee and any additional fee have been paid (R. 71 (9) EPC).

              Under Article 86(2) EPC, the obligation to pay renewal fees to the European Patent Office terminates with the
              payment of the renewal fee due in respect of the year in which the mention of the grant of the European
              patent is published.

            Filing of translations in the Contracting States

              As regards translation requirements prescribed by the Contracting States under Article 65(1) EPC, please
              consult the website of the European Patent Office
            www.epo.org -'Patents ->Law -'Legal texts -'National law relating to the EPC
            www.epo.org -'Patents ->Law -'Legal texts -'London Agreement

              In case of a valid extension

              As regards translation requirements prescribed by the Extension States, please consult the website of the
             European Patent Office
            www.epo.org -'Patents ->Law -'Legal texts -'National law relating to the EPC

              Failure to supply a prescribed translation in a Contracting State or an Extension State may result in
              the patent being deemed to be void ab initio in the State concerned (Article 65(3) EPC).

              Important note to users of the automatic debiting procedure

            The fees for grant and printing and also any additional Claims fees due under Rule 71 (6) EPC will be debited
              automatically on the date of filing of the translation of the (relevant) Claims, or on the last day of the period of
              this communication. However, if the designation fees become due as set out in Rule 71 (8) EPC and/or a
              renewal fee becomes due as set out in Rule 71(9) EPC, these should be paid separately by another permitted
            means of payment in order not to delay the publication of the mention of grant. The same applies in these
            Circumstances to the payment of extension fees. For further details see the Arrangements for the automatic
            debiting procedure (AAD) and accompanying Information from the EPO concerning the automatic debiting
              procedure (Annexes A.1 and A2 to the Arrangements for deposit accounts (ADA) in Supplement to OJ EPO
            3/2009).
