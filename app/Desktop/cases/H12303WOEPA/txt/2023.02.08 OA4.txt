                 (2013-05-22)

2        While the Applicant's observations submitted with the amended claims (letter of

         10-05-2022) have been carefully considered, the Examining Division

         nevertheless maintains the opinion, that the subject-matter of the independent

         claims 1, 8, 12, 19 and 23 is still so unclear (Article 84 EPC), that a meaningful

         and efficient assessment of inventive step appears only be possible after these

         claims are rendered clear by the Applicant through further amendments.

         The arguments brought forward by the Applicant with respect to clarity are not
         convincing.

         It is pointed out, that according to the Guidelines F-IV, 4.1 the meaning of the
         terms of a claim must, as far as possible, be clear for the person skilled in the
         art from the wording of the claim alone (see also F-IV, 4.2). It is opinion of the
         Examining Division, that the following issues are not at all clear from the
         wording of the claims as currently on file:

Date                            Sheet 2      ApplicationNo:

                                Feuille      Demande n°:

       The application does not meet the requirements of Article 84 EPC, because
       claims 1, 8, 12 and 19 are still not clear.

3.1    In independent claims1 and 12 it is not clear whether it is the "device", which
3.2    is sending the "first fault tracing detection request packet" or a different entity
3.2.1  (Article 84 EPC).
3.2.2
       The expressions "ault tracing detection", "initiating fault detection" and ""service
3.3    chain fault detection" used in independent claims 1, 8, 12 and 19 leave the
       reader in doubt as to the meaning of the technical features to which they refer,
       thereby rendering the definition of the subject-matter of said claims unclear
       (Article 84 EPC and Guidelines F-lV-4.1 and F-lV-4.3):

       In particular, it is impossible for the person skilled in the art to derive, e.g. from
       the subject-matter of claim 1, which faults are exactly to be detected resp.
       traced and how such a taut detection is actually achieved? It is entirely unclear
       how fault tracing/detecting can be achieved merely by requesting/sending/
       obtaining just lD's of one SF node and one SFE?

       Moreover claim 1 defines "service chain fault detection method, wherein the

       rvi h in m ri                l r li f rvi f n i n n   butclaim1 only

       obtains/provides the ID of only one SF node, but what about the other SF nodes

       on the path?)

       It is not clear for the person skilled in the art. that by the method steps defined

       in|im1vnh hnrrfrvifninn                               inwfin

       flin             lnn  r      in rrfh  rvi fninn       hlln

       actually can be determined.

       It appears, that in best case it can o_nly be determined, whether "the ID of one
       SF node" obtained in the "fault tracing detection response packet" is included in
       the memory of the SFE as a forwarding entry and nothing more. Apparently, no
       other faults, if this can be considered as a fault at all, may be detected. Hence, it
       appears, that there are essential features missing to define this specific
       scenano.

       Therefore claims 1, 8, 12 and 19 do not meet the requirements of Article 84
       EPC in that the matter for which protection is sought is not defined. The claims
       attempt to define the subject-matter in terms of the result to be achieved.

       Claims 8 and 19 do not meet the requirements of Article 84 EPC in that the
       matter for which protection is sought is not defined. The claims attempt to define
       the subject-matter in terms of the result to be achieved. Such a definition is only
       allowable under the conditions elaborated in the Guidelines F-IV, 4.10. In this

           instance, however, such a formulation is not a||owab|e because it appears
           possible to define the subject-matter in more concrete terms, viz. in terms of
           how the effect is to be achieved.

           Claims 8 and 19 define "determining, by the device for initiating fault detection,
          that forwarding between the SFE and the SF node is normal based on the
           received ID of the SF node", without specifying how is actually achieved only by
           obtaining just one ID of an SF node?

            It appears, that in best case it can o_n|y be determined, whether "the ID of one
           SF node" obtained in the "fault tracing detection response packet" is included in
          the memory of the SFE as a forwarding entry and nothing more. Apparently, no
           other faults, if this can be considered as a fault at all, may be detected. Hence, it
           appears, that there are essential features missing to define this specific
           scenano.

          Most importantly, just knowing that the ID of a SF node is included in the
           memory of the SFE, does not mean by any means, that "the forwarding between
           the SFE and the SF node is normal". There are countless fault possibilities,
           such as port, link, transmission problems, etc. between the SFE and the SF
          node (the SF might be out of service entirely), for which the forwarding between
           the SFE and the SF node is n_ot normal!

          Therefore, also claims 8 and 19 do not meet the requirements of Article 84
          EPC in that the matter for which protection is sought is not defined. The claims
           attempt to define the subject-matter in terms of the result to be achieved.

           It is not at present apparent which part of the application could serve as a basis
           for a new, a||owab|e claim. Should the Applicant nevertheless regard some
           particular matter as patentable, an independent claim should be filed taking
           account of Rule 43(1) EPC. The Applicant should also indicate in the letter of
           reply the difference of the subject-matter of the new claim vis-a-vis the state of
          the art and the significance thereof, preferably using the problem-solution
           approach.

           Moreover when filing an amended set of claims, the Applicant is requested to
           also take the following remarks into account:

4.1 New independent claims should be drafted in the two-part form in accordance
          with Rule 43(1) EPC.

4.2 When filing amended claims the Applicant should at the same time bring the
           description into conformity with the amended claims in particular in
           compliance with the Guidelines F-IV 4.3(iii), F-IV 4.4 and C-V 1.1.0: in order

       to meet the requirement of Article 84 EPC, that the claims have to be
       supported by the description, all embodiments of the description should
       fall into the scope of the claim set. Other embodiments should either be
       excised or it should be stated that they do not fall into the scope of the
       claim set ("... does not fall under the invention"). A mere renaming of such
       other embodiments, such as for instance "examples" or "aspects" is not
       sufficient.

       Care should be taken during revision, especially of the introductory portion and
       any statements of problem or advantage, not to add subject-matter which
       extends beyond the content of the application as originally filed (Article 123(2)
       EPC).

       Further the attention of the Applicant is drawn to the fact that amended claims
       may not relate to unsearched subject--matter (Rule 137(4) EPC).

4.3    In order to facilitate the examination of the conformity of the amended

       application with the requirements of Article 123(2) EPC, the Applicant is

       requested to clearly identify the amendments carried out, irrespective of

       whether they concern amendments by addition, replacement or deletion, and to

       indicate the passages of the application as filed on which these

       amendments are based.
