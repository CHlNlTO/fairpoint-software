Finally, claim 8 has been amended to specify "obtaining, by the SFE, the ID of the SF
node from the first fault tracing detection request packet". This is directly and
unambiguously derivable from par. [0123] of the original description which discloses
"thefirst obtaining unit 1107 may obtain the ID ofthe SFnode 121from thefault tracing
detection requestpacket1042.". The cited paragraph discloses that the firs obtaining unit
is in the SFE node. Therefore, the first obtaining unit in the SFE obtaining the ID of the
SF node discloses "obtaining, by the SFE, an ID of the SF node".

Claim 19 has been amended in an analogous manner.

Thus, all amendments meet the requirements of Art. 123(2) EPC.

II. Two-part form, Rule 43(1) EPC

In response to the request for two-paIt form in section 4.1 of Office Action 5, 0A5, it is
submitted that the subject matter of new claims 1 and 8 relates to a method whose
method steps are interrelated with each other, while the inventive step concerns changes
in several of these interrelated method steps. Further, the subj ect matter of claims 12 and
19 relates to a complex apparatus of functionally inter-related parts, while the inventive
step concerns changes in several of these parts of the apparatus. Therefore, the use of the
two-part form is considered to be inappropriate, since it would give a distorted picture
of the claimed invention and would lead to an artificial lack of clarity of the respective
claim. Hence, it is requested to allow the one-paIt form in the present case.

III. Clarity

The Examining Division in Section 3.1 of 0A5 objects that "Claims 8 and 19 define
"determining, by the device for initiating fault detection, thatforwarding between the
SFE and the SF node is normal based on the received ID of the SF node", without
specifying how is actually achieved only by obtaining just one ID of an SF node" and
that "The claims attempt to define the subject--matter in terms of the result to be
achieved."

To proceed with the application in a favorable manner, claims 8 and 19 have been
amended to clarify how the forwarding between the SFE and the SF node is determined
to be normal based on the received ID of the SF node.

Specifically, new claims 8 and 19 now clearly specify steps wherein a first fault tracing
request packet must traverse from the device for initiating fault detection to the SFE,
then to the SF node, and back. Furthermore, new claims 8 and 19 also provide include
steps wherein the SFE obtains the ID of the SF node after the SF node adds the ID to the

                                                                                                                                                                                 2/4
                                                   13$ BOEHMERT & BOEHMERT

first fault tracing request packet and sends the first fault tracing detection request packet
back to the SFE. Finally, the SFE obtains the ID of the SF node from the returned first
fault tracing detection request packet. As a result, the device for initiating fault detection
can determine that the forwarding between the SFE and SF node is normal based on this
obtained ID of the SF node as the SF node has to receive the first fault tracing detection
request packet, add an ID of the SF node to it and then successfully send the packet back
to the SFE.

Thus, it is clear to the skilled person that the ID of the SF node is an indicator of normal
forwarding as it can only be obtained after the SF node receives the first fault tracing
request packet, adds the ID of the SF node to the packet and sends it back to the SFE.
Therefore, if an ID of the SF node is obtained, then that means the first fault tracing
request packet traversed through the SFE and SF node and back, that is, the forwarding
between the SFE and SF node is normal.

In other words, if there were a fault between the SFE and SF node, the SF node would
not be able to receive and/or send back the first fault tracing request packet. As a result,
the SFE would not be able to obtain an ID of the SF node from the packet and the
forwarding between the SFE and SF would be determined to be not normal, indicating a
fault, which can be any sort of fault, between the SFE and SF node.

Therefore, at least new claims 8 and 19 clarify the steps leading up to obtaining the ID of
the SF node and how this ID is used to determine that the forwarding between the SFE
and SF node is normal.

Thus, at least all new claims meet the requirements of Art. 84 EPC.

IV. Novelty and Inventive Step

The Examining Division in Section 1 of the Office Action concedes that claims 1, 12 and
23 are novel and inventive. Furthermore, the Examining Division seemingly concedes
that claims 8 and 19 are also novel and inventive - the only clarity objection has been
overcome.

V. Conclusion

In view of the amendments made and the above explanations, it is believed that the
application is now in a state acceptable for grant. Should the Examining Division,
nevertheless, still see deficiencies in the documents on file, it is kindly asked to give the
applicant the opportunity to file further arguments and, if necessary, amendments.
Minor issues could be discussed by telephone.
