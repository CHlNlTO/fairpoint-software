           The Examining Division is of the opinion, that the subject-matter of
           independent claim 1, 12 and 23 including respective dependent claims
          fulfils the requirements of Article 52(1).
          However the following objections and defects have to be overcome before a
           possible grant of a patent:

          While the Applicant's observations submitted with the amended claims (letter of
           02-06-2023) have been carefully considered, the Examining Division maintains
           the opinion, that the subject-matter of the other independent claims 8 and 19
          still does not fulfil the requirements of Article 84 EPC. The arguments brought
          forward by the Applicant in favour of clarity of claims 8 and 19 have been found
           as not convincing (please refer to point 3.1. of this communication).

          The application does not meet the requirements of Article 84 EPC, because
           independent claims 8 and 19 are still not clear.
3.1 Claims 8 and 19 do not meet the requirements of Article 84 EPC in that the
          matter for which protection is sought is not defined. The claims attempt to define
          the subject-matter in terms of the result to be achieved. Such a definition is only
           allowable under the conditions elaborated in the Guidelines F-IV, 4.10. In this

           instance, however, such a formulation is not allowable because it appears
           possible to define the subject-matter in more concrete terms, viz. in terms of
          how the effect is to be achieved.

          Claims 8 and 19 define "determining, by the device for initiating fault detection,
          that forwarding between the SFE and the SF node is normal based on the
          received ID of the SF node", without specifying how is actually achieved only
          by obtaining just one ID of an SF node ("based on the received ID of the SF
          node") for all possible and countless fault possibilities?

           It appears, that in best case it can o_n|y be determined, whether "the ID of one
           SF node" obtained in the "fault tracing detection response packet" is included in
          the memory of the SFE as a forwarding entry and nothing more. Apparently, no
          other faults, if this can be considered as a fault at all, may be detected. Hence, it
           appears, that there are essential features missing to define this specific
           scenario.

          Most importantly, just receiving the ID of a SF node, does not mean by any
          means, that "the forwarding between the SFE and the SF node is normal".
           There are countless fault possibilities, such as port, link, transmission
           problems, etc. between the SFE and the SF node (the SF might be out of
          service entirely), for which the forwarding between the SFE and the SF
           node is n_ot normal!

           Therefore, claims 8 and 19 do not meet the requirements of Article 84 EPC in
           that the matter for which protection is sought is not defined. The claims attempt
           to define the subject-matter in terms of the result to be achieved.

           In his letter of reply, the Applicant argues:

           "It is clear that to implement normal forwarding of the service packet, a
           detection device in the network detects whether the SFE and the SF node can
          forward the service packet and through the correct path. If a fault (any kind of
          fault) occurs, the normal forwarding of the service packet is affected. Using the
          path ID and the ID of the SFE, the fault can be traced. The applicant notes that
           any fault can be detected and traced through this technique."

           However, these arguments do not address the Examining Divisions objection,
          how the device can possibly "determine normal forwarding between the SFE
          and SF" just "based on the received ID of the SF node".

           In consequence, it is respectfully proposed to either amend the subject-matter of
          independent claims 8 and 19 or to delete claims 8-11 and 19-22 altogether to
           obtain an allowable set of claims.

       Otherwise, the Applicant is advised, that the Examining Division is minded to
       refuse the application (Article 97(2) EPC), as currently on file, on grounds of
       lack of clarity (Article 84 EPC) only.

       Moreover when filing an amended set of claims, the Applicant is requested to

       also take the following remarks into account:

4.1    New independent claims should be drafted in the two-part form in accordance

       with Rule 43(1) EPC.

4.2 When filing amended claims the Applicant should at the same time bring the
           description into conformity with the amended claims in particular in
           compliance with the w, F-IV 4.4 and C-V 1.1.0: in order
          to meet the requirement of Article 84 EPC, that the claims have to be
           supported by the description, all embodiments of the description should
          fall into the scope of the claim set. Other embodiments should either be
           excised or it should be stated that they do not fall into the scope of the
          claim set ("... does not fall under the invention"). A mere renaming of such
           other embodiments, such as for instance "examples" or "aspects" is not
           sufficient.

       Care should be taken during revision, especially of the introductory portion and
       any statements of problem or advantage, not to add subject-matter which
       extends beyond the content of the application as originally filed (Article 123(2)
       EPC).

       Further the attention of the Applicant is drawn to the fact that amended claims
       may not relate to unsearched subject--matter (Rule 137(4) EPC).

4.3 In order to facilitate the examination of the conformity of the amended
          application with the requirements of Article 123(2) EPC, the Applicant is
           requested to clearly identify the amendments carried out, irrespective of
           whether they concern amendments by addition, replacement or deletion, and to
           indicate the passages of the application as filed on which these
           amendments are based.
