D1           EP 2 595 344 A2 (HUAWEI TECH co LTD [CN]) 22 May 2013

             (2013-05-22)

          While the Applicant's observations submitted with the amended claims (letter of
           05-07-2021) have been carefully considered, the Examining Division is of the
           opinion, that the subject-matter of the independent claims 1, 8, 12, 19 and 23
           still does not fulfill the requirements of Article 84 EPC and does not fulfill the
          requirements of Articles 52(1) and 56 EPC.
           It is maintained, that the subject-matter of claims 1, 8, 12 and 19 is so unclear,
           that a meaningful and efficient assessment of inventive step appears only be
          possible after these claims are rendered clear by the Applicant through further
           amendments.
          The details of all the objections can be found in the following under items 3 to 5
          of this communication:

          The application does not meet the requirements of Article 84 EPC, because
           claims 1, 8, 12 and 19 are still not clear.

3.1    The expressions "3;th tracing detection" and "initiating tam detection" used in

       independent claims 1, 8, 12 and 19 leave the reader in doubt as to the

       meaning of the technical features to which they refer (it is not clear which M

       are exactly to be detected resp. traced and how such a M detection is actually

       achieved only by obtaining just one ID of an SF node?; why is such a request

       packet sent?; | im 1 nl fin n ID

       other nodes on the path?), thereby rendering the definition of the subject-matter

       of said claims unclear (Article 84 EPC and Guidelines F-IV-4.1 and F-IV-4.3).

       |in Irfrh        rnkillinhrh                      hmh                   fin

       fault in a planned orocessing order of the service function nodes shall and

       actually can be determined.

       It appears, that in best case it can m be determined, whether "the ID of the SF
       node" obtained in the "fault tracing detection response packet" is included in the
       intended "order of the plurality of service function nodes of the service chain" or
       not. Apparently, no other faults may be detected. Hence, it appears, that there
       are essential features missing to define this specific scenario. Furthermore it is
       entirely unclear, what the feature "determining, by the SFE, to communicate
       with a service function, SF, node" contributes to this "fault tracing/
       detection" (see point 3.2 of this communication).

       Therefore claims 1, 8, 12 and 19 do not meet the requirements of Article 84
       EPC in that the matter for which protection is sought is not defined. The claims
       attempt to define the subject-matter in terms of the result to be achieved.

3.2    Moreover, the features " etermining, by the SFE, to communicate with a service

       function, SF, node" and "obtaining, by the SFE, an ID of the SF node" used in

       independent claims 1 and 12 are vague and leave the reader in doubt as to

       the meaning of the technical features to which they refer (it is vague and

       unclear, whether the SFE and SF node are actually communicating, how they

       are communicating and what is the purpose resp. outcome of that

       communication; in addition it is not clear, from where the SFE obtains the ID of

       the SF), thereby rendering the definition of the subject-matter of said claims

       unclear (Article 84 EPC and Guidelines F-IV-4.1 and F-IV-4.3).

3.3 Claims 8 and 19 do not meet the requirements of Article 84 EPC in that the
           matter for which protection is sought is not defined. The claims attempt to define
          the subject-matter in terms of the result to be achieved. Such a definition is only
           allowable under the conditions elaborated in the Guidelines F-IV, 4.10. In this

       instance, however, such a formulation is not allowable because it appears
       possible to define the subject-matter in more concrete terms, viz. in terms of
       how the effect is to be achieved.

       Claims 8 and 19 define "determining, by the device for initiating fault detection,
       that forwarding between the SFE and the SF node is normal based on the
       received ID of the SF node", without specifying how is actually achieved only by
       obtaining just one ID of an SF node?

       It appears, that in best case it can o_n|y be determined, whether "the ID of the SF
       node" obtained in the "fault tracing detection response packet" is included in the
       intended "order of the plurality of service function nodes of the service chain" or
       not. Apparently, no other faults may be detected and "normal" operation only
       with respect to the "order of service function nodes" may be determined. Hence,
       it appears, that there are essential features missing to define this specific
       scenario. In this context it is also pointed out, that independent claims 8 and
       19 (in contrast to independent claims 1 and 12) do not refer to any
       "communication between the SFE and the SF node", which appears as
       essential to the definition of the invention.

       The present application does not meet the requirements of Article 52(1) EPC,
       because the subject-matter of the independent claims 1, 8, 12, 19 and 23, as
       far as they can be understood, does not involve an inventive step in the sense
       of Article 56 EPC.

4.1    Document D1 (see in particular: paragraphs 1-11, 65-88, 103; claims 6-10;

       Figure 3), which is considered to represent the most relevant state of the art

       with respect to the subject-matter of claim 1, discloses (the references in

       parentheses applying to this document):

       A service chain fault detection method ('fault detection method': paragraph 7;
       claims 6-10), wherein the service chain comprises a plurality of service function
       nodes, and a packet passes through according to an order of the plurality of
       service function nodes, ('an MPLS ring network is an MPLS LSP transport
       ring network constructed by means of logical structure mapping, where a
       group of nodes form a closed ring, each node is connected through a
       bidirectional communication facility to two adjacent nodes, each node in
       the ring may serve as a ring ingress node or may also serve as a ring
       egress node, and the transport directions are opposite; each direction
       includes working and protective ring channels, and provides redundant
       bandwidth or redundant network devices or both; in this manner, after the

       automatically recover; to be simple, in the MPLS ring network scenario,
       paths are rings, and services may be transferred clockwise or
       counterclockwise; that is, two paths are able to protect each other; if a

       direction continues to transfer services to meet the objective that single-
       point link faults in a ring do not affect services'; "an order of the plurality

           after encapsulation to the ring ingress node 31'; the aforementioned
          features of claim 1 are considered, if not directly, at least implicitly
           disclosed in D1: paragraphs 65-88, 103).

4.2 The subject matter of claim 1 differs (only the underlined feature) from the
          method of D1 in that "after the obtaining, by the SFE, the first fault tracing
           detection request packet, the method further comprises: sending, by the SFE, a
           second fault tracino detection response packet to the device for initiatino fault
           detection. wherein the second fault tracino detection response Dacket
          comprises an ID of the SFE and the path ID", which is not explicitly disclosed in
           D1, however not considered to contribute anything towards an inventive step for
          the following reason. The proposed solution is considered an obvious, even
          trivial possibility for the person skilled in the art, which he would choose
           according to circumstances, namely depending on the requirements of
           operation and maintenance and/or network design, without exercise of an
           inventive skill. Moreover, the additional feature also does not result in an
          additional surprising technical effect.

          Therefore the subject-matter of claim 1 does not involve an inventive step and
          does not satisfy the criterion set forth in Articles 52(1) and 56 EPC.

4.3 The same objection of lack of inventive step also applies to independent
           claims 8, 12, 19 and 23, which essentially contain or should contain the
           corresponding combination of features as defined by claim 1.

           Claims 8, 12, 19 and 23 are thus also not allowable under Articles 52(1) and 56
           EPC for the same reasons set out above with respect to claim 1.

           It is not at present apparent which part of the application could serve as a basis
           for a new, allowable claim. Should the Applicant nevertheless regard some
           particular matter as patentable, an independent claim should be filed taking
           account of Rule 43(1) EPC. The Applicant should also indicate in the letter of
           reply the difference of the subject-matter of the new claim vis-a-vis the state of
          the art and the significance thereof, preferably using the problem-solution
           approach.

           Moreover when filing an amended set of claims, the Applicant is requested to
           also take the following remarks into account:

5.1 New independent claims should be drafted in the two-part form in accordance
          with Rule 43(1) EPC.

5.2 When filing amended claims the Applicant should at the same time bring the
           description into conformity with the amended claims in particular in
           compliance with the w, F-IV 4.4 and C-V 1.1.0: in order
          to meet the requirement of Article 84 EPC, that the claims have to be
           supported by the description, all embodiments of the description should
          fall into the scope of the claim set. Other embodiments should either be
           excised or it should be stated that they do not fall into the scope of the
          claim set ("... does not fall under the invention"). A mere renaming of such
           other embodiments, such as for instance "examples" or "aspects" is not
           sufficient.

       Care should be taken during revision, especially of the introductory portion and
       any statements of problem or advantage, not to add subject-matter which
       extends beyond the content of the application as originally filed (Article 123(2)
       EPC).

       Further the attention of the Applicant is drawn to the fact that amended claims
       may not relate to unsearched subject--matter (Rule 137(4) EPC).

5.3    In order to facilitate the examination of the conformity of the amended

       application with the requirements of Article 123(2) EPC, the Applicant is

       requested to clearly identify the amendments carried out, irrespective of

       whether they concern amendments by addition, replacement or deletion, and to

       indicate the passages of the application as filed on which these

       amendments are based.
