   D1    EP 2 595 344 A2 (HUAWEI TECH CO LTD [CN]) 22 May 2013

         (2013-05-22)

2        The application does not meet the requirements of Article 84 EPC, because

         claims 1, 9, 14 and 22 are not clear.

2.1 The expression "service chain detection" used in independent claims 1 and 9
           leaves the reader in doubt as to the meaning of the technical features to which
          it refers (it is not clear from the wording of claims whether a "service chain" or a
          "fault in the service chain" should be detected?), thereby rendering the definition
          of the subject-matter of said claims unclear (Article 84 EPC and Guidelines F-
          |V-4.1 and F-IV-4.3).

         Since the features of the independent claims only refer to "fault tracing/
         detection", it appears, that these claims should be amended e.g. as follows:
         'service chain fault detection'

2.2 The expression "service chain" used in the independent claims 1, 9, 14 and
          22 is vague and leaves the reader in doubt as to the meaning of the technical
          features to which it refers (which service and which chain?; to what exactly are
          these terms referring to and how are they defined?), thereby rendering the
          definition of the subject-matter of said claims unclear (Article 84 EPC and
          Guidelines F-IV-4.1 and F-IV-4.3).

2.3 The expressions "M tracing detection" and "initiating fa_u|t detection" used in
           independent claims 1, 9, 14 and 22 leave the reader in doubt as to the
          meaning of the technical features to which they refer (it is not clear which M
           are exactly to be detected resp. traced and how such a fa_u|t detection is actually
           achieved only by obtaining |D's?; why is such a request packet sent?; claim 1
          only defines an ID of the SF node. but what about the other nodes on the
          pa_th?), thereby rendering the definition of the subject-matter of said claims
          unclear (Article 84 EPC and Guidelines F-IV-4.1 and F-IV-4.3).

           It is not clear for the person skilled in the art. that by the method stebs defined
           in claim 1 (they do not even mention anvthind about an order of service function
           nodes) a fault in a planned brocessino order of the service function nodes shall
           and actually can be determined.

           Therefore claims 1, 9, 14 and 22 do not meet the requirements of Article 84
          EPC in that the matter for which protection is sought is not defined. The claims
           attempt to define the subject-matter in terms of the result to be achieved.

2.4 Likewise claims 9 and 22 do not meet the requirements of Article 84 EPC in
           that the matter forwhich protection is sought is not defined. The claims attempt
          to define the subject-matter in terms of the result to be achieved. Such a
          definition is only allowable under the conditions elaborated in the Guidelines F-
           IV, 4.10. In this instance, however, such a formulation is not allowable because
           it appears possible to define the subject-matter in more concrete terms, viz. in
          terms of how the effect is to be achieved.

          Claims 9 and 22 define "determining, by the device for initiating fault detection,
          that forwarding between the SFE and the SF node is normal", without specifying
           how is actually achieved only by obtaining ID's?

        The present application does not meet the requirements of Article 52(1) EPC,
        because the subject-matter of the independent claims 1, 9, 14, 22 and 27, as
        far as they can be understood, is not new in the sense of Article 54(1) and (2)
        EPC.

3.1     Document D1 (see in particular: paragraphs 7, 65-88, 103; claims 6-10)

        discloses according to all the features of claim 1 (the references in

        parentheses applying to this document):

        A service chain detection method ('fault detection method': paragraph 7;
        claims 6-10), wherein the method comprises:

                        Feuille  Demande n°:

          obtaining, by a service forwarding entity, SFE, a first fault tracing detection
           request packet, and determining, by the SFE, to communicate with a service
           function, SF, node, wherein the first fault tracing detection request packet
          comprises a path identifier, ID, and the path ID is used to identify a path of a
           service chain ('initiate a fault detection request packet; determine a ring
           LSP FEC corresponding to the fault detection request packet, and
           encapsulate the ring LSP FEC into the fault detection request packet; the
           ring LSP FEC specifically includes the ring ingress node address, the ring
          egress node address and a ring identity'; the 'ring identity' in D1 is
           understood as a possible "path ID"; 'send the fault detection request
           packet along to downstream nodes'; a 'downstream node' in D1 is
           understood as an "SFE"; the aforementioned features of claim 1 are
           considered to be at least implicitly disclosed in D1: paragraphs 65-88);

          obtaining, by the SFE, an ID of the SF node; and sending, by the SFE, a first
           fault tracing detection response packet to a device for initiating fault detection,
           wherein the first fault tracing detection response packet comprises the path ID
           and the ID of the SF node ('the control plane queries a downstream
          information mapping table of the ring LSP FEC to acquire downstream
           information of LSR2, which includes the address of the downstream node
           LSR3 and the outgoing label, encapsulates the downstream information of
           LSR2 into a fault detection reply packet, and returns the fault detection
           reply packet, Tracert echo reply, to LSR1; the fault detection reply packet
           includes information of LSR2 and information of LSR3; LSR1 determines,
           according to the returned information of LSR2 and information of LSR3,
          that the LSR2 node of the ring LSP has no fault, and determines that the
          next node of LSR2 is LSR3'; e.g. 'LSR3' in this particular scenario in D1 is
           understood as a possibility of an "SF"; 'encapsulate the ring LSP FEC into
          a fault detection reply packet, and send the fault detection reply packet
           after encapsulation to the ring ingress node 31'; the aforementioned
          features of claim 1 are considered to be at least implicitly disclosed in D1:
           paragraphs 65-88, 103).

          The subject-matter of claim 1 is therefore not new (Article 54(1) and (2) EPC).

3.2 The same objection of lack of novelty also applies to independent claims 9,
           14, 22 and 27, which essentially contain or should contain the corresponding
          combination of features as defined by claim 1.

           Claim 9, 14, 22 and 27 is thus also not allowable under Articles 52(1), 54(1) and
           (2) EPC for the same reasons set out above with respect to claim 1.

        Dependent claims 2-8, 10-13, 15-21, 23-26 do not appear to contain any
        additional features, which in combination with the features of any claim to which
        they refer meet the requirements of the EPC with respect to novelty and
        inventive step, the reasons being as follows:

4.1     All the features of the dependent claims 2-8, 10-13, 15-21, 23-26, if not

        already directly or implicitly disclosed in D1, are considered obvious, if not

        trivial, possibilities for the person skilled in the art, which he would choose

        according to circumstances, namely depending on the requirements of

        operation and maintenance and/or network design, without exercise of an

        inventive skill.

        Claims 2-8, 10-13, 15-21, 23-26 do not involve an inventive step in the sense of
        Article 56 EPC and therefore the requirements of Article 52(1) are not met.

          It is not at present apparent which part of the application could serve as a basis
           for a new, allowable claim. Should the Applicant nevertheless regard some
           particular matter as patentable, an independent claim should be filed taking
          account of Rule 43(1) EPC. The Applicant should also indicate in the letter of
          reply the difference of the subject-matter of the new claim vis-a-vis the state of
          the art and the significance thereof, preferably using the problem-solution
           approach.

           Moreover when filing an amended set of claims, the Applicant is requested to
           also take the following remarks into account:

5.1 To meet the requirements of Rule 42(1)(b) EPC, document D1 should be
          identified in the description and the relevant background art disclosed therein
          should be briefly discussed.

5.2 The vague and imprecise statements in the description on page 71 (paragraph
           310) imply, that the subject-matter for which protection is sought may be
          different to that defined by the claims, thereby resulting in lack of clarity of the
           claims (Article 84 EPC) when used to interpret them (see the Guidelines, F-IV,
          4.4). These statements should therefore be amended to remove this
           inconsistency.

5.3 The "incorporated herein by reference" statement in the description on page 1
           (paragraph 1) should be deleted, since the invention should be self contained
          (see the Guidelines H-V, 2.5).

5.4 For clarity reasons (Article 84 EPC) paragraphs 311-359 relating to further
           Embodiments 1-48 on pages 71 -85 should be deleted.

5.5 New independent claims should be drafted in the two-part form in accordance
          with Rule 43(1) EPC.

5.6 The features of the claims should be provided with reference signs placed in
          parentheses to increase the intelligibility of the claims (Rule 43(7) EPC). This
           applies to both the preamble and characterising portion (see the Guidelines, F-
          IV, 4.19).

5.7 When filing amended claims the Applicant should at the same time bring the
           description into conformity with the amended claims in particular in
           compliance to the Guidelines F-IV 4.3(iii), F-IV 4.4 and C-V 1.1.0. Care
          should be taken during revision, especially of the introductory portion and any
           statements of problem or advantage, not to add subject-matter which extends
          beyond the content of the application as originally filed (Article 123(2) EPC).

           Further the attention of the Applicant is drawn to the fact that amended claims
          may not relate to unsearched subject-matter (Rule 137(4) EPC).

5.8 In order to facilitate the examination of the conformity of the amended
          application with the requirements of Article 123(2) EPC, the Applicant is
          requested to clearly identify the amendments carried out, irrespective of
           whether they concern amendments by addition, replacement or deletion, and to
           indicate the passages of the application as filed on which these
           amendments are based.
