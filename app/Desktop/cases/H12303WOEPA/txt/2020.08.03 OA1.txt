D1            EP 2 595 344 A2 (HUAWEI TECH co LTD [CN]) 22 May 2013

              (2013-05-22)

        While the Applicant's observations submitted with the amended claims (letter of
        04-05-2020) have been carefully considered, the previously expressed opinion
        is nevertheless maintained. The Examining Division is of the opinion, that the
        subject-matter of the independent claims 1, 9, 14, 22 and 27 still does not
        fulfill the requirements of Article 84 EPC, and maintains its interpretation of the
        disclosure of D1 with respect to Articles 52(1) and 54 EPC.

        The details of all the objections can be found in the following under items 3 to 5
        of this communication:

        The application does not meet the requirements of Article 84 EPC, because
        claims 1, 9, 14 and 22 are still not clear.

3.1     The expressions "M tracing detection" and "initiating my_lt detection" used in

        independent claims 1, 9, 14 and 22 leave the reader in doubt as to the

        meaning of the technical features to which they refer (it is not clear which faults

        are exactly to be detected resp. traced and how such a M detection is actually

        packet sent?; | im 1 nl fin n ID
        other nodes on the path?), thereby rendering the definition of the subject-matter

        actually can be determined.

        It appears, that in best case it can m be determined, whether "the ID of the SF
        node" obtained in the "fault tracing detection response packet" is included in the
        intended "order of the plurality of service function nodes of the service chain" or
        not. Apparently, no other faults may be detected. Hence, it appears, that there
        are essential features missing to define this specific scenario.

        Therefore claims 1, 9, 14 and 22 do not meet the requirements of Article 84
        EPC in that the matter for which protection is sought is not defined. The claims
        attempt to define the subject-matter in terms of the result to be achieved.

3.2     Likewise claims 9 and 22 do not meet the requirements of Article 84 EPC in

        that the matter for which protection is sought is not defined. The claims attempt

        to define the subject-matter in terms of the result to be achieved. Such a

        definition is only allowable under the conditions elaborated in the Guidelines F-

        IV, 4.10. In this instance, however, such a formulation is not allowable because

        it appears possible to define the subject-matter in more concrete terms, viz. in

        terms of how the effect is to be achieved.

        Claims 9 and 22 define "determining, by the device for initiating fault detection,
        that forwarding between the SFE and the SF node is nQrma without specifying
        how is actually achieved only by obtaining just one ID of an SF node?

        It appears, that in best case it can o_n|y be determined, whether "the ID of the SF
        node" obtained in the "fault tracing detection response packet" is included in the
        intended "order of the plurality of service function nodes of the service chain" or
        not. Apparently, no other faults may be detected and "normal" operation only
        with respect to the "order of service function nodes" may be determined. Hence,
        it appears, that there are essential features missing to define this specific
        scenano.

4      The present application does not meet the requirements of Article 52(1) EPC,

       because the subject-matter of the independent claims 1, 9, 14, 22 and 27, as

       far as they can be understood, is not new in the sense of Article 54(1) and (2)

       EPC.

4.1    Document D1 (see in particular: paragraphs 1-11, 65-88, 103; claims 6-10;

       Figure 3) discloses according to all the features of claim 1 (the references in

       parentheses applying to this document):

       A service chain fault detection method ('fault detection method': paragraph 7;
       claims 6-10), wherein the service chain comprises a plurality of service function
       nodes, and a packet passes through according to an order of the plurality of
       service function nodes, ('an MPLS ring network is an MPLS LSP transport
       ring network constructed by means of logical structure mapping, where a
       group of nodes form a closed ring, each node is connected through a
       bidirectional communication facility to two adjacent nodes, each node in
       the ring may serve as a ring ingress node or may also serve as a ring
       egress node, and the transport directions are opposite; each direction
       includes working and protective ring channels, and provides redundant
       bandwidth or redundant network devices or both; in this manner, after the
       network becomes invalid or deteriorates, distributed services are able to
       automatically recover; to be simple, in the MPLS ring network scenario,
       paths are rings, and services may be transferred clockwise or
       counterclockwise; that is, two paths are able to protect each other; if a
       path in one direction is interrupted, the protective path in the opposite
       direction continues to transfer services to meet the objective that single-
       point link faults in a ring do not affect services`; "an order of the plurality
       of service function nodes" is considered, if not directly, at least implicitly
       given in an 'MPLS ring network' as disclosed in D1: paragraphs 1-11;
       claims 6-10; Figure 3), wherein the method comprises:

       obtaining, by a service forwarding entity, SFE, a first fault tracing detection
       request packet, and determining, by the SFE, to communicate with a service
       function, SF, node, wherein the first fault tracing detection request packet
       comprises a path identifier, ID, and the path ID is used to identify a path of a
       service chain ('initiate a fault detection request packet; determine a ring
       LSP FEC corresponding to the fault detection request packet, and
       encapsulate the ring LSP FEC into the fault detection request packet; the
       ring LSP FEC specifically includes the ring ingress node address, the ring
       egress node address and a ring identity'; the 'ring identity' in D1 is
       understood as a possible "path ID"; 'send the fault detection request

           packet along to downstream nodes'; a 'downstream node` in D1 is
           understood as an "SFE"; the aforementioned features of claim 1 are
           considered to be at least implicitly disclosed in D1: paragraphs 65-88);

          obtaining, by the SFE, an ID of the SF node; and sending, by the SFE, a first
           fault tracing detection response packet to a device for initiating fault detection,
           wherein the first fault tracing detection response packet comprises the path ID
           and the ID of the SF node ('the control plane queries a downstream
          information mapping table of the ring LSP FEC to acquire downstream
           information of LSR2, which includes the address of the downstream node
           LSR3 and the outgoing label, encapsulates the downstream information of
           LSR2 into a fault detection reply packet, and returns the fault detection
           reply packet, Tracert echo reply, to LSR1; the fault detection reply packet
           includes information of LSR2 and information of LSR3; LSR1 determines,
           according to the returned information of LSR2 and information of LSR3,
          that the LSR2 node of the ring LSP has no fault, and determines that the
           next node of LSR2 is LSR3'; e.g. 'LSR3' in this particular scenario in D1 is
           understood as a possibility of an "SF"; 'encapsulate the ring LSP FEC into
          a fault detection reply packet, and send the fault detection reply packet
           after encapsulation to the ring ingress node 31'; the aforementioned
          features of claim 1 are considered, if not directly, at least implicitly
           disclosed in D1: paragraphs 65-88, 103).

          The subject-matter of claim 1 is therefore not new (Article 54(1) and (2) EPC).

4.2 The same objection of lack of novelty also applies to independent claims 9,
           14, 22 and 27, which essentially contain or should contain the corresponding
          combination of features as defined by claim 1.

           Claim 9, 14, 22 and 27 is thus also not allowable under Articles 52(1), 54(1) and
           (2) EPC for the same reasons set out above with respect to claim 1.

           It is not at present apparent which part of the application could serve as a basis
           for a new, allowable claim. Should the Applicant nevertheless regard some
           particular matter as patentable, an independent claim should be filed taking
           account of Rule 43(1) EPC. The Applicant should also indicate in the letter of
           reply the difference of the subject-matter of the new claim vis-a-vis the state of
          the art and the significance thereof, preferably using the problem-solution
           approach.

           Moreover when filing an amended set of claims, the Applicant is requested to
           also take the following remarks into account:

5.1 New independent claims should be drafted in the two-part form in accordance

        with Rule 43(1) EPC.

5.2 When filing amended claims the Applicant should at the same time bring the
           description into conformity with the amended claims in particular in
           compliance with the Guidelines F-IV 4.3(iii), F-IV 4.4 and C-V 1.1.0: in order
          to meet the requirement of Article 84 EPC, that the claims have to be
           supported by the description, all embodiments of the description should
          fall into the scope of the claim set. Other embodiments should either be
           excised or it should be stated that they do not fall into the scope of the
          claim set ("... does not fall under the invention"). A mere renaming of such
           other embodiments, such as for instance "examples" or "aspects" is not
           sufficient.

       Care should be taken during revision, especially of the introductory portion and
       any statements of problem or advantage, not to add subject-matter which
       extends beyond the content of the application as originally filed (Article 123(2)
       EPC).

       Further the attention of the Applicant is drawn to the fact that amended claims
       may not relate to unsearched subject-matter (Rule 137(4) EPC).

5.3    In order to facilitate the examination of the conformity of the amended

       application with the requirements of Article 123(2) EPC, the Applicant is

       requested to clearly identify the amendments carried out, irrespective of

       whether they concern amendments by addition, replacement or deletion, and to

       indicate the passages of the application as filed on which these

       amendments are based.
