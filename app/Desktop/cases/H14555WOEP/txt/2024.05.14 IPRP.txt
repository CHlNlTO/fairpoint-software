2. FURTHER ACTION

    If a demand for international preliminary examination is made, this opinion will be considered to be a written opinion of the
    International Preliminary Examining Authority ("IPEA") except that this does not apply where the applicant chooses an Authority
    other than this one to be the IPEA and the chosen IPEA has notified the International Bureau under Rule 66.1bis(b) that written
    opinions of this International Searching Authority will not be so considered.
    If this opinion is, as provided above, considered to be a written opinion of the IPEA, the applicant is invited to submit to the IPEA
    a written reply together, where appropriate, with amendments, before the expiration of 3 months from the date of mailing of Form
    PCT/ISA/220 or before the expiration of 22 months from the priority date, whichever expires later.

    For further options, see Form PCT/ISA/220.

Box No. I            Basis of the opinion

1. With regard to the language, this opinion has been established on the basis of:          which is the language of a translation

           the international application in the language in which it was filed.

          a translation of the international application into
           furnished for the purposes of international search (Rules 12.3(a) and 23.1(b)).

2.         This opinion has been established taking into account the rectification of an obvious mistake authorized by or notified to

           this Authority under Rule 91 (Rule 43bis.1(b)).

3.      With regard to any nucleotide and/or amino acid sequence disclosed in the international application, this opinion has been

        established on the basis of a sequence listing:

    a.     forming part of the international application as filed.

    b.     furnished subsequent to the international filing date for the purposes of international search (Rule 13ter.1(a)),

                     accompanied by a statement to the effect that the sequence listing does not go beyond the disclosure in the international
                     application as filed.

4.         With regard to any nucleotide and/or amino acid sequence disclosed in the international application, this opinion has been

           established to the extent that a meaningful opinion could be formed without a WIPO Standard ST.26 compliant sequence

           listing.

     D1: WO 2021196054 A1

     D1 is the closest prior art document, and discloses (see description, page 12, line 1 to page 37, last line): an
     encoding method for a polar code, comprising: respectively acquiring a first bit and a second bit, the type of
     the first bit being a known bit, and the type of the second bit comprising at least one of a frozen bit, a parity
     check bit or an information bit; generating a pilot sequence on the basis of the first bit; encoding the second bit
     to obtain a first encoding sequence; and when determining to send the pilot sequence, sending a second encoding
     sequence to a decoding device, wherein the second encoding sequence comprises the pilot sequence and the first
     encoding sequence. A decoding method for a polar code, comprising: receiving a message from an encoding
     apparatus, the message comprising a subsequence to be decoded, the subsequence comprising a first bit, and the
     type of the first bit being a known bit; and using the type of the first bit as a target type, and decoding the first
     bit according to a first decoding algorithm corresponding to the target type, the target type comprising a parity
      check bit or a frozen bit.

     Novelty

     Claim 1 at least differs from D1 by: determining a first frozen bit sequence on the basis of a probability
      distribution value P1 of a first information bit sequence.

     Claim 11 at least differs from D1 by: on the basis of an ith probability distribution value in a probability
     distribution value set P and a frozen bit sequence corresponding to an ith probability distribution value,
     decoding a sequence to be decoded.

     D1 does not explicitly or implicitly disclose the technical solutions of claims 1-30. Therefore, claims 1-30 are
     novel in the sense of PCT Article 33(2).

     Inventive Step

     It would not have been possible for a person skilled in the art to obviously arrive at the technical solutions of
     claims 1-30 from any combination of D1 and common general knowledge. Therefore, claims 1-30 involve an
     inventive step in the sense of PCT Article 33(3).

     Industrial Applicability

     The technical solutions of claims 1-30 can be made or used in industry, and thus, claims 1-30 are industrially
     applicable in the sense of PCT Article 33(4).

The following defects in the form or contents of the international application have been noted:

     Claims 5, 6, 9, 10, 18-21, and 24 are themselves multiple dependent claims and refer to preceding multiple
     dependent claims, and therefore do not comply with PCT Rule 6.4(a).
