Communication pursuant to Rules 70(2) and 70a(2) EPC

A supplementary European search report has been drawn up concerning the above-identified European
patent application (publication number: 4412116).

Since the request for examination has been filed (R. 70(1), 159(1)(f), Art. 94(1) EPC) prior to the
transmission of the supplementary European search report, you are hereby invited to indicate within

                                                      six months

of notification of this communication whether you wish to proceed further with the European patent

application.

If you do not indicate in due time that you wish to proceed further with the European patent application, it
will be deemed to be withdrawn (R. 70(3) EPC).

You are invited, within the above-mentioned six-month period, to comment on the objections raised in the
opinion accompanying the European search report and/or to file any amendments to the description,
claims and drawings correcting any deficiencies noted in the opinion (R. 70a(2), R. 137(2) EPC;
Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, B-XI, 8).

If filing amendments, you must identify them and indicate the basis for them in the application as filed.
Failure to meet either requirement may lead to a communication from the Examining Division requesting
that you correct this deficiency (R. 137(4) EPC).

Should the reply to the invitation pursuant to Rule 70a(2) EPC be filed in an admissible non-EPO
language, a translation is to be submitted within one month of its filing (R. 6(2) EPC).

Should you not comply with this invitation within the time limit, the application will be deemed to be
withdrawn in accordance with Rule 70a(3) EPC.
